End-users of Boundary can use the Desktop app to connect to a running
Boundary server to easily:

- Browse available targets
- Connect to targets
- Manage active sessions

Security administrators use the Boundary CLI and API to automate infrastructure
access management, but the Desktop app makes Boundary accessible to low-code and
no-code users. Users that establish sessions with targets often
find the browse, connect, and manage functionality convenient for day-to-day
operations.

In this tutorial, you will install the Boundary Desktop app, start Boundary in
dev mode and connect to a target.

## Prerequisites

1. A MacOS, Windows, or Linux Workstation
1. Boundary is still running in [dev
   mode](/boundary/tutorials/oss-getting-started/oss-getting-started-dev)

## Start a dev environment

Boundary Desktop connects with a running instance of a Boundary controller. In
non-dev environments, Boundary Desktop would connect to this running controller
without hosting it locally.

In this tutorial, you will run a Boundary controller locally using dev mode.

You already have a Boundary instance running in dev mode. If not, start it again.

```shell-session
$ boundary dev

Recall that Boundary starts in dev mode with default authentication credentials and
a set of pre-defined [resources](/boundary/docs/concepts/domain-model).

These admin credentials enable you to log into the Boundary console.

- Generated Auth Method Login Name: `admin`
- Generated Auth Method Password: `password`

-> The default login name and password can be overwritten with `-login-name` and
`-password` flags (e.g. `boundary dev -login-name="dev-admin" -password="p@ssw0rd"`).

If you have any trouble getting dev mode to start properly, refer back to the
[Start a Development Environment](/boundary/tutorials/oss-getting-started/oss-getting-started-dev)
tutorial and then come back here.

## Authenticate with Boundary Desktop

Next you will launch the Boundary Desktop app and connect it to the running
controller.

1. Open the Boundary Desktop app installed earlier.

   You will be prompted for the Boundary Cluster URL, which is the URL for the
   client to connect to the controller via the Boundary API. Running in dev
   mode, this will be `http://127.0.0.1:9200`

   ![Boundary Desktop URI](/img/boundary/desktop/desktop-cluster-url_light.png#light-theme-only)
   ![Boundary Desktop URI](/img/boundary/desktop/desktop-cluster-url_dark.png#dark-theme-only)

1. Select the `Global` scope. In non-dev environments you would select the
   scope you have been provided access credentials for.

1. Select **Generated global scope initial password auth method**. In non-dev environments, you may have the option to select a different auth method.

1. Enter `admin` in the **Login Name** field.

   This is the _Generated Auth Method Login Name_.

1. Enter `password` in the **Password** field.

   This is the _Generated Auth Method Password_.

1. Click **Sign In**.

   ![Boundary Desktop Login](/img/boundary/desktop/desktop-login_light.png#light-theme-only)
   ![Boundary Desktop Login](/img/boundary/desktop/desktop-login_dark.png#dark-theme-only)

   You are presented with the _Targets_ view, which contains a target generated using a direct address and a target generated using host sources. The _Generated target with a direct address_ with the ID `ttcp_1234567890` is the default target enabled by
   dev mode on your localhost.

   ![Initial Targets](/img/boundary/desktop/desktop-targets-initial_light.png#light-theme-only)
   ![Initial Targets](/img/boundary/desktop/desktop-targets-initial_dark.png#dark-theme-only)

## Connect to a target

Next you will connect to the default target using the Desktop app.

1. Establish a connection

   Click on **Connect** next to the default target.

   You will be presented with a screen that displays the target's connection
   info. You can copy the connection details to your clipboard by clicking the
   buttons to the right of the **Address & port** or **SSH** fields.

   ![Connection Details](/img/boundary/desktop/desktop-connection-details_light.png#light-theme-only)
   ![Connection Details](/img/boundary/desktop/desktop-connection-details_dark.png#dark-theme-only)

1. Copy the target's connection details

   In this example, we are using SSH to connect. On the **Details** tab, select **SSH** and then click the copy button.

   ![Copy Connection Details](/img/boundary/desktop/desktop-copy-connection-details_light.png#light-theme-only)
   ![Copy Connection Details](/img/boundary/desktop/desktop-copy-connection-details_dark.png#dark-theme-only)

1. View the pending connection

   Navigate to the _Sessions_ view using the sidebar on the
   left. Notice that the status for the Generated target has been updated to
   `Pending`.

   ![Pending Target Connection](/img/boundary/desktop/desktop-sessions-pending_light.png#light-theme-only)
   ![Pending Target Connection](/img/boundary/desktop/desktop-sessions-pending_dark.png#dark-theme-only)

1. Start an SSH session

   Select the ID of the target, and then select the **>_ Shell** tab. Paste the information you copied into the shell and run it. Enter your local administrator
   password when prompted to connect to the localhost target.

   ![SSH Connection Established](/img/boundary/desktop/desktop-ssh-connection_light.png#light-theme-only)
   ![SSH Connection Established](/img/boundary/desktop/desktop-ssh-connection_dark.png#dark-theme-only)

   -> Issues connecting or disconnects right after entering your password could
   be due to SSH restrictions on your local machine. Using **System
   Preferences** in MacOS, click **Sharing**, ensure that **Remote Login** is
   enabled, and check the **Allow access for** section to make sure that your
   user has the correct permissions to log in.

   Once connected, the _Sessions_ view in the Boundary Desktop app should show the
   Generated target's status has been updated to `Active`.

   ![Pending Target Connection](/img/boundary/desktop/desktop-sessions-active_light.png#light-theme-only)
   ![Pending Target Connection](/img/boundary/desktop/desktop-sessions-active_dark.png#dark-theme-only)

1. Terminate the connection

   You can close the active session directly from the Boundary Desktop app.

   Under the _Sessions_ view, click **Cancel** to the right of the status for
   the Generated target. The status will update to `Canceling` and a
   confirmation dialog should appear to verify the successful session
   termination.

   ![Terminate Target Connection](/img/boundary/desktop/desktop-sessions-cancelled_light.png#light-theme-only)
   ![Terminate Target Connection](/img/boundary/desktop/desktop-sessions-cancelled_dark.png#dark-theme-only)

1. Clean up

   Shutdown the dev environment by navigating back to the terminal session used
   to run `boundary dev`, and enter the `ctrl+c` keystroke to shutdown the dev
   server.

   <CodeBlockConfig hideClipboard>

   ```shell-session
   ^C==> Boundary dev environment shutdown triggered
   T13:45:14.835-0600 [INFO]  worker: status ticking shutting down
   T13:45:14.836-0600 [INFO]  controller: recovery nonce ticking shutting down
   T13:45:14.836-0600 [INFO]  controller: terminating completed sessions ticking shutting down
   T13:45:14.836-0600 [INFO]  controller: status ticking shutting down
   $
   ```

   </CodeBlockConfig>

## Next steps

You installed the Boundary Desktop app, connected to a running controller and
viewed and managed an SSH session using the app. The Desktop app is typically
used for session management, while the Admin console is used for administrative
tasks like defining and managing Users, Groups, Roles, Projects and Host
Catalogs.

The next step is to [configure](/boundary/tutorials/oss-getting-started/oss-getting-started-config) and
manage targets that your organization wishes to protect. The recommended
approach is to use Terraform to codify the Boundary configuration.
