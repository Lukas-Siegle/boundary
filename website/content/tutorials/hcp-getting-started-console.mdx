You can access your HCP Boundary instance through the Boundary web UI using a
browser or Command Line Interface (CLI) using the [installed Boundary
binary](/boundary/tutorials/hcp-getting-started/hcp-getting-started-install).

Before you can use the Boundary CLI, you must complete the initial setup using
the Boundary web UI. In this tutorial series you will use the **Manual** setup
wizard to have a better understanding of how Boundary is organized.

## Prerequisites

- An HCP account to complete this tutorial.
- [Boundary 0.12.0 installed](/boundary/tutorials/hcp-getting-started/hcp-getting-started-install).

## Boundary UI

1. From the HCP Portal's **Boundary** page, click **Open Admin UI** - a new page
   will open.

1. Enter the admin username and password you created when you deployed the new
   instance and click **Authenticate**.

   You are now logged into your HCP Boundary instance via the web UI and
   presented with the Boundary setup wizard.

   <Note> 

     The setup wizard can create sample resources for quick testing by
     providing a target ID and connection port. This tutorial illustrates the
     process of setting up Boundary projects and targets manually to show new
     users around the UI. To use the setup wizard instead, enter a test target's
     public IP address and TCP connection port, such as `18.206.227.218` and `22`
     if using SSH.

   </Note>

1. Click **Do this later**.

1. Click **New**.

1. In the **Name** field enter `quick-start-org` and click **Save**.

   You are now authenticated to your HCP Boundary instance's Global scope via
   the web UI. This is the default scope for all new Boundary clusters.

1. The **Org Settings** page includes the **Name** of the org, an optional
   **Description**, and the org ID (highlighted).

   ID's are an important concept to understand in Boundary. Each resource in
   Boundary is identified by an ID. ID's are commonly referenced when managing
   your Boundary instance, or connecting to Boundary resources. These additional
   resources will be covered throughout the Getting Started series.

## Boundary CLI

1. From the [Boundary web UI](#boundary-ui), click the org menu and select
   **quick-start-org**.
   ![ui-boundary-select-org](/img/boundary/ui-boundary-select-org.png)

1. Click **Org Settings**.

1. Copy the org ID by clicking the copy icon.
   ![ui-boundary-copy-orgid.pngui-boundary-copy-orgid](/img/boundary/ui-boundary-copy-orgid.png)

1. Switch to your terminal and export a environment variable for the org ID.

   ```shell-session
   $ export ORG_ID=<actual-org-id>
   ```

1. Click **Orgs** in the left navigation menu to return to the global scope.

   <Note> 

     You can verify the active org in the Boundary UI by the org pull down menu.

   </Note>

1. Click **Auth Methods** and copy the **Password** auth method ID.
   ![ui-boundary-copy-pw-auth-id](/img/boundary/ui-boundary-copy-pw-auth-id.png)

1. Open your terminal and set an environment variable named
   `BOUNDARY_AUTH_METHOD_ID` to the copied ID.

   ```shell-session
   $ export BOUNDARY_AUTH_METHOD_ID=<actual-auth-id>
   ```

1. Close the Boundary web UI.

1. Return to the HCP Portal **Boundary** page and click the copy icon for the
   Cluster URL in the **Getting started with Boundary** section.
   ![ui-hcp-getting-started-boundary](/img/boundary/ui-hcp-getting-started-boundary.png)

1. In your terminal, set the `BOUNDARY_ADDR` environment variable to the copied URL.

   ```shell-session
   $ export BOUNDARY_ADDR=<actual-boundary-address>
   ```

1. Log in with the administrator credentials you created when you deployed the
   HCP Boundary instance. When prompted, enter the administrator username and
   password you selected when creating your Boundary instance.

   ```shell-session
   $ boundary authenticate
   Please enter the login name (it will be hidden):
   Please enter the password (it will be hidden):
   Authentication information:
     Account ID:      acctpw_VOeNSFX8pQ
     Auth Method ID:  ampw_wxzojlKJLN
     Expiration Time: Mon, 13 Feb 2023 12:35:32 MST
     User ID:         u_1vUkf5fPs9
   The token was successfully stored in the chosen keyring and is not displayed here.
   ```

You are now logged into your HCP Boundary instance's **Global** scope via the
CLI. This is the default scope for all new Boundary clusters.

## Next steps

Now that you have authenticated to the HCP Boundary instance, you are ready to
setup and connect to your first target.
