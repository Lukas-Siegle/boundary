HashiCorp Cloud Platform (HCP) enables you to quickly deploy a production ready
Boundary instance. As a fully managed service, it allows you to leverage
Boundary to enable access to dynamic infrastructure while offloading the
operational burden to the Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) experts at
HashiCorp.

In this tutorial, you will deploy a Boundary instance guided by the HCP portal.

## Prerequisites

- An HCP account to complete this tutorial.
- [Boundary 0.12.0 installed](/boundary/tutorials/hcp-getting-started/hcp-getting-started-install).

## Create a Boundary instance

1. Launch the [HCP Portal](https://portal.cloud.hashicorp.com/sign-up?utm_source=learn&utm_content=tutorial_boundary) and login.

1. From the **Overview** page, click **Boundary** in the left navigation menu.

1. Click **Deploy Boundary**.

1. In the **Instance Name** text box, provide a name for your Boundary instance.

1. Under the **Create an administrator account** section, enter the **Username** and **Password** for the initial Boundary administrator account.

  <Note>

   The Boundary instance is publicly accessible. Be sure to use a non-standard username (e.g. not root or administrator) and create a strong password.

   </Note>

1. Click **Deploy**.
   ![ui-hcp-boundary-start-deploy](/img/boundary/ui-hcp-boundary-start-deploy.png)

   Wait for the instance to initialize before proceeding.

1. Open a new terminal and export an environment variable for the username.

   ```shell-session
   $ export BOUNDARY_ADMIN=<actual-username-created>
   ```

   <Note>

   Creating the environment variables for the Boundary is not required, but used for the ease of following the tutorials.

   </Note>

   <Warning>

   If the HCP Boundary status does not change change from **Creating** to **Running** after a few minutes, refresh the page.

   </Warning>

## Boundary overview

When the HCP Boundary deployment completes, you will be redirected to the **Boundary Overview** page. The overview page provides details about instance.

1. Instance details
1. Instructions on connecting Boundary Desktop to the HCP Boundary instance.
1. Session usage, including active and terminated sessions.

## Next steps

You have successfully created a Boundary instance on the HashiCorp Cloud Platform. In the next tutorial
you will learn how to connect to HCP Boundary though the Boundary admin console and Boundary CLI.
