This tutorial series demonstrates how to configure remote access to Kubernetes
clusters using `kubectl`. HashiCorp Vault is used to generate just-in-time
credentials to prevent remote users from storing permanent Kubernetes tokens
locally.

## Scenario

Your organization is undergoing a security transformation under the direction of
the new Chief Security Officer.

The developer team has requested remote access to their production Kubernetes
environment to view running pods. However, the new operations team security
policies require limiting teams to only have access to resources necessary to
perform their job duties. The existing VPN solution is not able to limit access
to specific endpoints, and anyone that connects to the VPN has access to the
entire network.

Additionally, the operations team is trying to limit the use of long-lived
credentials that provide access to production environments.

The teams work together, discussing the challenges and requirements on what
needs to be implemented to ensure production runs smoothly.

## Challenge

The traditional VPN and jump/bastion hosts allow remote users to access their
infrastructure resources. The challenge with this approach is that the VPN and
jump hosts have limited capabilities to control users' access once they
are on the network.

In addition, the VPN and jump hosts have limited (if any) capabilities to manage
short-lived credentials across the various types of resources in the
environment. Each person who requires access would need a dedicated, long-lived
username on the jump host and in the Kubernetes environment.

Using long-lived static credentials limits the operations team's ability to
control access to their infrastructure. Long-lived user credentials are a
security concern and increase the risk of the credentials being exposed and used
by hackers. The operations team does not currently have a method to use
short-lived credentials, and requires additional tools to ensure these
credentials are generated just-in-time and expire appropriately.

## Solution

HashiCorp Boundary is a tool for managing identity-based access for modern,
dynamic infrastructure. Remote users can access their assigned infrastructure
resources using credentials associated with an existing identity provider (Okta,
Ping, Active Directory, etc) without having to store or manage long-lived
credentials to the different target resources. The operations team can centrally
control and precisely assign the resources each remote user is allowed to
access.

To facilitate the use of short-lived credentials, Boundary can integrate with
HashiCorp Vault to provide credentials when needed, and configured with a TTL
that will expire the credentials. Once expired, credentials will no longer grant
access to the production environment.

In this series of tutorials you will configure Boundary to allow the DevOps team
access their Kubernetes clusters using `kubectl`. You will leverage HashiCorp
Vault to generate just-in-time credentials, so remote users do not need to store
permanent Kubernetes tokens on their local machines.

## Personas

The end-to-end scenario described in this tutorial series involves two personas:

- `operations` with privileged permissions to deploy and manage Boundary, Vault,
  and Kubernetes
- `developers` granted access Kubernetes by the `operations` team

You will start by assuming the role of a Boundary operator who is deploying and
configuring the environment for the first time. Then you will test the
experience of a Kubernetes developer by remotely connecting to the assigned
Kubernetes cluster. The goal is to show the end-to-end experience of both the
administrator and end user so you understand how everything works.

## Prerequisites

The tutorials in this series assume a working knowledge of Boundary, Vault, and
Kubernetes.

If you are not familiar with Boundary, complete the [HCP
Boundary](/boundary/tutorials/hcp-getting-started) or [self-managed
Boundary](/boundary/tutorials/oss-getting-started) quick start tutorials.

If you are not familiar with Vault, complete the [HCP
Vault](/vault/tutorials/cloud) or [Vault CLI](/vault/tutorials/getting-started)
quick start tutorials.

<Note>

  You can complete this tutorial using HashiCorp Cloud Platform (HCP) or by
  using a Vault dev server and Boundary's dev mode. If you use dev mode, an HCP
  account is not required as a prerequisite.

</Note>

- A [Boundary binary](/boundary/install/) greater than 0.13.0 in your `PATH`
- [Boundary
  Desktop](/boundary/tutorials/oss-getting-started/oss-getting-started-desktop-app)
  is installed
- A [Vault binary](/vault/install/) greater than 1.7.0 in your `PATH`
- An [HCP account](https://portal.cloud.hashicorp.com/sign-in?utm_source=learn)
- An HCP user assigned the contributor role (or higher) to perform allow the
  creations of HCP Vault Dedicated and HCP Boundary clusters.
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) installed
- [minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/) installed
- [Kubernetes command-line interface
  (CLI)](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/) installed
- [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/download) installed and configured with an auth
  token (Vault Dedicated only)

### Tools for this lab

This tutorial was last tested on 8 August 2023 using macOS 13.4. Before moving
on, check that the following versions or greater are installed.

<Note>

Newer versions should work, but have the potential to introduce new behavior
that may cause one or more steps to fail.

</Note>

1. Verify the version of Boundary.

   ```shell-session
   $ boundary version

   Version information:
     Build Date:          2023-06-09T16:42:30Z
     Git Revision:        6eb1c9919f495b21ca900e89b2a7e2f735a79fbc
     Version Number:      0.13.1
   ```

1. Verify the version of Boundary Desktop. The `brew` utility is only available
   on macOS.

   ```shell-session
   $ brew info hashicorp-boundary-desktop
   ==> hashicorp-boundary-desktop: 1.6.0
   https://www.boundaryproject.io/
   /usr/local/Caskroom/hashicorp-boundary-desktop/1.6.0 (122B)
   From: https://github.com/hashicorp/homebrew-tap/blob/HEAD/Casks/hashicorp-boundary-desktop.rb
   ==> Name
   Boundary Desktop
   ==> Description

   ==> Artifacts
   Boundary.app (App)
   ```

1. Verify the version of Vault.

   ```shell-session
   $ vault --version
   Vault v1.14.1 (bf23fe8636b04d554c0fa35a756c75c2f59026c0), built 2023-07-21T10:15:14Z
   ```

1. Verify the version of Docker.

   ```shell-session
   $ docker --version
   Docker version 24.0.2, build cb74dfc
   ```

1. Verify the version of minikube.

   ```shell-session
   $ minikube version
   minikube version: v1.31.1
   commit: fd3f3801765d093a485d255043149f92ec0a695f
   ```

1. Verify the version of kubectl. This step assumes you have not used minikube
   to start Kubernetes.

   ```shell-session
   $ kubectl version --short
   Flag --short has been deprecated, and will be removed in the future. The --short output will become the default.
   Client Version: v1.27.2
   Kustomize Version: v5.0.1
   ```

## Next steps

You have verified the installation and version of each tool used in subsequent
tutorials.

In the [Connect to Kubernetes using Boundary lab
setup](/boundary/tutorials/kubernetes-connect/kubernetes-getting-started-setup)
tutorial, you will start an environment that consists of Boundary, Vault, and
Kubernetes. Once each service is started, you will verify connectivity to each
service.
