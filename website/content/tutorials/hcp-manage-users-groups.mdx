Users and groups in Boundary are collectively known as **principals**. Assigning
[grants](/boundary/docs/concepts/security/permissions) on
[roles](/boundary/docs/concepts/domain-model/roles) is
performed through principal IDs; that is, the unique IDs of users, groups, or
both.

This tutorial focus on completing user management tasks within a Boundary
environment.

<Note>

All resource IDs in this tutorial are illustrations only. IDs are uniquely
generated for every resource upon creation. Be sure to use the resource IDs that are
generated for your environment.

</Note>

## Prerequisites

This tutorial assumes that you successfully completed the [Manage
Scopes](/boundary/tutorials/hcp-administration/hcp-manage-scopes) tutorial.

## Users

Users in Boundary represent an _internal_ notion of a particular entity (human,
machine, etc.). Users can be correlated with one or more
[account](/boundary/docs/concepts/domain-model/accounts)
resources via [auth
methods](/boundary/docs/concepts/domain-model/auth-methods).
Accounts represent _external_ notions of a particular entity. Among other
use-cases, this mechanism allows for an easy way to switch users to new IdPs
within the organization deploying Boundary.

An auth method can be defined at the org and global scopes. In this tutorial,
you will create an account and user for an auth method at the org level.

~> Currently, all auth methods create users upon authentication. If there is no
user linked with an account, Boundary creates a user when the authentication
against that account was successful. This behavior may be convenient, but in
other situations (such as when you want Terraform to describe the Boundary
resources), this may be undesirable. The steps in this tutorial demonstrate
manually making these resources and linking them. A future Boundary update will
allow turning off auto-vivification on a per-auth-method basis.

## Add an auth method

Enable a password-type auth method in the `IT_Support` org which you created in
the [Manage Scopes](/boundary/tutorials/hcp-administration/hcp-manage-scopes) tutorial.

<Tabs>
<Tab heading="CLI" group="cli">


Create a password auth method in the `IT_Support` org.

```shell-session
$ boundary auth-methods create password \
  -scope-id=$ORG_ID \
  -name="org_auth_method" \
  -description="Org auth method"
```

**Example:**

<CodeBlockConfig hideClipboard>

```shell-session
$ boundary auth-methods create password \
  -scope-id=$ORG_ID \
  -name="org_auth_method" \
  -description="Org auth method"

In this example output, the password auth method ID is `ampw_ZbB6UXpW3B`.

Copy the auth method ID and save it as an environment variable, `BOUNDARY_AUTH_METHOD_ID`.

<Tab heading="Terraform" group="terraform">

In your Terraform configuration file, define a [`boundary_auth_method`
resource](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/boundary/latest/docs/resources/auth_method)
to create a new auth method under the `IT_Support` scope which you created in
the [Manage Scopes](/boundary/tutorials/hcp-administration/hcp-manage-scopes) tutorial.

```hcl

## Create an account

Create an account for the org-scoped auth method.

<Note>

 User names must be all lowercase alphanumeric of at least 3
characters and the password must be 8 or more characters. (The minimum lengths
can be changed in the attributes for the auth method if desired.)

<Tab heading="CLI" group="cli">

Create an account named "test_account". For the password, use `supersecure`. Or, use a password of your choosing, but be sure to remember it!

This tutorial uses a pre-existing admin account to manage Terraform resources.
This approach allows Boundary to be configured programmatically, with minimal
bootstrapping of Boundary with accounts or users. If using this method, consider
utilizing [Terraform input
variables](/terraform/language/values/variables), like the sample
code for this tutorial demonstrates. Also note that the account must already
exist in order for Terraform to manage resources using this method.

To [configure the Boundary provider using
Terraform](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/boundary/latest/docs),
provide the valid auth method ID, login name, and password for a pre-existing
auth method to authenticate. The user must have appropriate grants assigned to
manage resources in the desired scope. The next tutorial will discuss roles and
grants.

```hcl
provider "boundary" {
  addr                            = "http://127.0.0.1:9200"
  auth_method_id                  = "ampw_sOXVI7JS2l"
  password_auth_method_login_name = "tester01"
  password_auth_method_password   = "supersecure"
}
```

These values can be hard-coded into the Terraform config, or supplied using
variables like this tutorial demonstrates.

Do **NOT** add this configuration to your `main.tf` file. It has already been
configured.

</Tab>
</Tabs>

## Groups

A group in Boundary is a resource that represents a collection of users that are
treated equally for the purposes of access control. A group is a principal,
which allows it to be assigned to roles. Roles assigned to a group are
indirectly assigned to the users in the group, and users receive all permissions
of the assigned roles. Groups can be defined at the
[Global](/boundary/docs/concepts/domain-model/scopes#global),
[Organization](/boundary/docs/concepts/domain-model/scopes#organizations),
or
[Project](/boundary/docs/concepts/domain-model/scopes#projects)
scope.

The group resource membership is managed manually. If using an [OIDC
Auth](/boundary/tutorials/access-management/oidc-auth) provider, such
as Auth0, Okta or Azure AD, [Managed
Groups](/boundary/docs/concepts/domain-model/managed-groups)
can be used to automatically map membership to a collection of accounts defined
by the auth method's identity provider using
[filtering](/boundary/docs/concepts/filtering/oidc-managed-groups).

Note: Objects have changed outside of Terraform

Terraform detected the following changes made outside of Terraform since the last "terraform apply":

  # boundary_target.tests has been changed
  ~ resource "boundary_target" "tests" {
      + application_credential_source_ids = []
        id                                = "ttcp_HwZP7XG1PR"

        # (7 unchanged attributes hidden)

Unless you have made equivalent changes to your configuration, or ignored the relevant attributes using ignore_changes, the following plan may
include actions to undo or respond to these changes.

Terraform used the selected providers to generate the following execution plan. Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols:
  + create

Terraform will perform the following actions:

By itself, group membership does not inherently assign its members any
permissions. In the next tutorial, a
[role](/boundary/docs/concepts/domain-model/roles) will be
assigned to the group and the included members will inherit the role's
permissions.

## Next steps

This tutorial demonstrated the steps to add a new authentication method to an
org (`IT_Support`), created a new user and group within the org, and added the
user as a member of the group. You verified that you can authenticate and logged
into the `IT_Support` org using the newly created user credential.

The next step is to define the permissions to control what operations members of
the group can perform. In the [Manage Roles and
Permissions](/boundary/tutorials/hcp-administration/hcp-manage-roles) tutorial, you will create a
role, assign grants to the role, and then add the group as a principle of the
new role. This group members will then inherit the defined permissions.
