[Targets](/boundary/docs/concepts/domain-model/targets) are
Boundary resources that contain one or more [host
sets](/boundary/docs/concepts/domain-model/host-sets). A
target allows Boundary users to define an endpoint with a default port and a
protocol to establish a session. Unless specified with a `-host-id` flag,
Boundary will choose one
[Host](/boundary/docs/concepts/domain-model/hosts) in the
host set to connect to at random.

This tutorial demonstrates the basics of how to define a host, host set, and a
target in Boundary on the CLI, the admin console, and using our [Terraform
provider](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-boundary).

<Warning>

All resource IDs in this tutorial are illustrations only. IDs are uniquely
generated for every resource upon creation with the exception being generated
resources in development mode. Be sure to use the resource IDs that are
generated for your environment.

</Warning>

You will create a host catalog, a host set containing hosts, and a
target.

## Prerequisites

This tutorial assumes that you successfully completed the [Manage
Scopes](/boundary/tutorials/oss-administration/oss-manage-scopes) tutorial.

### Setup a PostgreSQL target

Deploy a postgres database container, which will be configured as a
target.

Launch the container by passing the postgres password, sample database name, and
URL port mapping as options. In this example the sample database is named
"sample".

Export the database URL as an environment variable.

```shell-session
$ export PG_URL="postgres://postgres:secret@localhost:16001/sampledb?sslmode=disable"
```

Next, start the Postgres container.

```shell-session
$ docker run -d \
   -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=secret \
   -e POSTGRES_DB="sampledb" \
   --name postgres \
   -p 16001:5432 \
   postgres
```

Check that the container is running.

```shell-session
$ docker ps --format "table {{.ID}}\t{{.Names}}\t{{.Image}}\t{{.Status}}"
CONTAINER ID   NAMES       IMAGE      STATUS
af573c7093cd   postgres   postgres   Up About a minute
```

## Add hosts to project

Hosts and host sets are defined within a host catalog, so you need to create a
host catalog first.

1. Create a host catalog named, "DevOps" with description, "For DevOps usage" in
   the `QA_Tests` project.

   ```shell-session
   $ boundary host-catalogs create static \
     -scope-id=$PROJECT_ID \
     -name=DevOps \
     -description="For DevOps usage"
   ```

   **Example output:**

   ```shell-session
   $ boundary host-catalogs create static \
     -scope-id=$PROJECT_ID \
     -name=DevOps \
     -description="For DevOps usage"

          list
   ```

   </CodeBlockConfig>

1. Copy the generated host catalog ID and save it as an environment variabe,
   `HOST_CATALOG_ID`.

   ```shell-session
   $ export HOST_CATALOG_ID=<host_catalog_id>
   ```

   **Example:**

   ```shell-session
   $ export HOST_CATALOG_ID="hcst_xM3iCCkf1K"
   ```

1. Now, create a new host named, "postgres" with description, "Postgres host"
   under the newly created host catalog.

   ```shell-session
   $ boundary hosts create static \
     -name=postgres \
     -description="Postgres host" \
     -address="127.0.0.1" \
     -host-catalog-id=$HOST_CATALOG_ID
   ```

   **Example output:**

   </CodeBlockConfig>

1. Repeat the step to create another host named, "localhost".

   ```shell-session

     -name=localhost \
     -description="Localhost for testing" \
     -address="localhost" \

In your Terraform `main.tf` configuration file, define a
[`boundary_host_catalog_static`
resource](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/boundary/latest/docs/resources/host_catalog_static)
to create a new host catalog in the "IT_Support" project, and define a
[`boundary_host_static`
resource](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/boundary/latest/docs/resources/host_static)
to create two host definitions, one for `postgres` and another for `localhost`.

To define this same host using our Terraform provider:

## Create a host set

A host set groups together hosts. These hosts provide logically equivalent services.

![Scenario](/img/boundary/diagram-host-set.png)

<Note>

 A target works off of host sets. Therefore, even if there is only
one host, you still create a host set containing one host.

1. Create a host set named, "test-machines".

   ```shell-session
   $ boundary host-sets create static \

        delete
        add-hosts
        set-hosts
        remove-hosts
   ```

   </CodeBlockConfig>

   Copy the `test-machines` host set ID and save it as an environment variable,
   `HOST_SET_ID`.. In the example, the ID is `hsst_X8gmzYXbO4`.

   ```shell-session
   $ export HOST_SET_ID=<test-machines_HOST_SET_ID>
   ```

   **Example:**
   
   ```shell-session
   $ export HOST_SET_ID="hsst_X8gmzYXbO4"

   `localhost` host ID is `hst_FrdNPd9Zm9`. You will pass these IDs in the next
   step.

1. Add `postgres` and `localhost` hosts to the `test-machines` host set. Be sure

   In this example, the generated target ID is `ttcp_34yV5O9cwt`. Notice that
   target IDs starts with `ttcp_`.

   Copy the ID of the `tests` target and save it as an environment variable,

   ```shell-session
   $ export TARGET_ID=<postgres_TARGET_ID>
   ```   

   **Example:**   

   ```shell-session
   $ export TARGET_ID="ttcp_34yV5O9cwt"

1. Add the `test-machines` host set to the `postgres` target. Replace
   `<target_id>` with your postgres target ID, and `<host_set_id>` with your
   test-machines host set ID.

## Manage targets

First, verify you can connect to the target. Then update the target description.

<Tabs>
<Tab heading="CLI" group="cli">

Open a session to the postgres target using `boundary connect`. When prompted,
enter the password `secret` to connect.

```shell-session
$ boundary connect postgres -target-id $TARGET_ID -username postgres
Password for user postgres:
psql (13.2)
Type "help" for help.

postgres=#
```

<Note>

 If you followed the Admin Console workflow and did not export the
`TARGET_ID` environment variable, supply it directly instead. In this example
the target ID is `ttcp_34yV5O9cwt`.

</Note>

After successfully testing the connection, terminate the session by executing
`\q`.

Targets can be managed using arguments to the `boundary targets` command, such
as `update`, `delete`, `add-host-sources` and `delete-host-sources`.

Update the target description.

```shell-session
$ boundary targets update tcp -id $TARGET_ID -description "updated postgres target"

Copy the Proxy URL, such as `127.0.0.1:59801`.

Next, open a new terminal session. Use the `psql` client to establish a session
with the postgres container via the local proxy created by Boundary. Enter the
password `secret` when prompted for the `sampledb` database password.

```shell-session
$ psql -h 127.0.0.1 -p 59801 -d sampledb -U postgres

![Connect to postgres](/img/boundary/desktop/desktop-postgres-sampledb_light.png#light-theme-only)
![Connect to postgres](/img/boundary/desktop/desktop-postgres-sampledb_dark.png#dark-theme-only)

Enter `\q` when finished to close the session, or cancel the session from the
Desktop app.

From the Desktop app, select the `postgres` target to check its details.

![Desktop target details](/img/boundary/desktop/desktop-postgres-target-details_dark.png#dark-theme-only)

You should see the description `Postgres target` beneath the target name.

Targets can be managed using the Admin Console UI. 

Open the Admin Console in your web browser and navigate to the **Targets** view.

Next, click the `postgres` target to view its details. Select **Edit Form** to
update the target details. 

Enter `updated postgres target` and click **Save**.

![Boundary Desktop](/img/boundary/boundary-ui-target-10.png)

Open the Boundary Desktop app again and refresh the **Targets** view. You will
see the `updated postgres target` description in the `postgres` target details.

## Next steps

This tutorial demonstrated the steps to define and manage targets under a scope
(`QA_Tests`). Targets represent network services a user can connect to, such as
the `postgres` Docker container.

In the [Manage Users and Groups](/boundary/tutorials/oss-administration/oss-manage-users-groups)
tutorial, you will add and manage users in the `org` scope.
