End-users of HCP Boundary can utilize the Boundary Desktop app to connect to a running
HCP Boundary instance to easily:

- Browse available targets
- Connect to targets
- Manage active sessions

Security administrators use the Boundary CLI and API to automate infrastructure
access management, but the Desktop app makes Boundary accessible to low-code and
no-code users. Users that establish sessions with targets frequently will also
find the browse, connect, and manage functionality convenient for day-to-day
operations.

In this tutorial, you will install the Boundary Desktop app and connect to a running target.

- A publicly accessible Ubuntu instance used in the [Connect to Your First Target](/boundary/tutorials/hcp-getting-started/hcp-getting-started-connect) tutorial.

   You can retrieve this from the HCP Portal or run `echo $BOUNDARY_ADDR` from
   your terminal session.

1. Click **Choose a different scope** and select the `Global` scope.

## Connect to a target

Next you will connect to the default target using the Desktop app.

1. Establish a connection

   Click on **Connect** next to the default target.

   You will be presented with a screen that displays the target's connection
   info. You can copy the connection details to your clipboard by clicking the
   buttons to the right of the **Address & port** or **SSH** fields.
