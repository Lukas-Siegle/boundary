[OpenID Connect](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html) (OIDC)
is an internet-scale federated identity and authentication protocol built on top
of the [OAuth 2.0](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749) authorization framework
and the [JSON Object Signing and
Encryption](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7520) (JOSE) cryptographic system.
OIDC builds on top of the OAuth 2.0 authorization protocol to enable a user to
authorize a third-party application to access the userâ€™s identity and
authentication information.

The OIDC authentication method allows Boundary users to delegate authentication
to an OIDC provider. This feature allows Boundary to integrate with popular
identity providers like Auth0, cloud-hosted active directory services with an
OIDC frontend, and cloud identity management systems such as AWS IAM.

Boundary users can create, read, update, and delete new OIDC authentication
methods using the Admin Console UI, Boundary CLI, or the Boundary Terraform
provider to enable login. OIDC auth methods can also be utilized for logging
into the Admin Console and Desktop applications.

This tutorial provides an example of setting up OIDC with the Auth0 provider and
managing OIDC authentication methods.

### OIDC authentication methods overview

1. [Authentication workflow](#authentication-workflow)
1. [Auth0 configuration](#providers)
1. [Auth method creation](#auth-method-creation)
1. [Authentication states](#authentication-states)
1. [OIDC authentication](#authenticate-using-oidc)

## Prerequisites

- A [Boundary binary](/boundary/install/) greater than
  0.8.0 in your `PATH`

- This tutorial assumes you can [connect to an HCP Boundary
  cluster](/boundary/tutorials/hcp-getting-started/hcp-getting-started-console) **or** launch
  Boundary in [dev mode](/boundary/tutorials/oss-getting-started/oss-getting-started-dev).

- An [Auth0](https://auth0.com) test account. The associated email address
  should not be tied to another SSO method, so use of a personal account is
  recommended.

- Installing the [Boundary Desktop
  App](/boundary/tutorials/oss-getting-started/oss-getting-started-desktop-app) provides an optional
  workflow for this tutorial. The [1.2.0
  version](https://releases.hashicorp.com/boundary-desktop/1.2.0/) or above is
  required for OIDC support.

- Installing [Terraform 0.13.0 or greater](/terraform/tutorials/aws-get-started/install-cli)
  provides an optional workflow for this tutorial. The binary must be available
  in your `PATH`.

## Get setup

In this tutorial, you will test OIDC integrations using HCP Boundary or by
running a Boundary controller locally using dev mode.

<Variant slug="boundary-deploy" option="hcp">

The [HCP Quickstart](/boundary/tutorials/hcp-getting-started) tutorials
provide an overview of getting started with an HCP Boundary cluster.

If you have an HCP Boundary cluster deployed, the [Access HCP
Boundary](/boundary/tutorials/hcp-getting-started/hcp-getting-started-console) tutorial provides an
overview of configuring your local machine to authenticate with your HCP
cluster.

This tutorial provides both CLI and UI workflows for setting up OIDC
authentication.

<Tabs>
<Tab heading="Admin Console" group="admin">

To proceed with the UI workflow:

1. Open the Admin Console UI by entering your HCP Boundary Cluster URL into a
   browser (such as
   `https://e58fe114-7624-431c-994d-b6670e90b03J.boundary.hashicorp.cloud`).

1. Enter the admin username and password you created when you deployed the new
   instance and click **Authenticate**.

![Admin UI Login](/img/boundary/boundary-ui-login-hcp_light.png#light-theme-only)
![Admin UI Login](/img/boundary/boundary-ui-login-hcp_dark.png#dark-theme-only)

You are now logged into your HCP Boundary instance's **Global** scope using the
web UI. This is the default scope for all new Boundary clusters. You can now
proceed to the [Providers](#providers) section to proceed with the Admin Console
UI workflow.

</Tab>
<Tab heading="CLI" group="cli">

To proceed with the CLI workflow:

1. Log in to the Boundary web UI and copy your org ID by clicking the copy icon.

   Open a terminal session and **set a environment variable for the org ID.**

   ```shell-session
   $ export ORG_ID=<org-id>
   ```

1. In the Boundary web UI, click **Orgs** in the left navigation menu to return
   to the global scope, and then click **Auth Methods**.

   Click the copy icon for the **Password** auth method.

   In your terminal **set an environment variable named `BOUNDARY_AUTH_METHOD_ID`** to the
   copied ID.

   ```shell-session
   $ export BOUNDARY_AUTH_METHOD_ID=<auth-method-id>
   ```

   Close the Boundary web UI.

1. Return to the HCP web Portal **Boundary** page, then click the copy icon for
   the **Cluster URL** in the **Getting started with Boundary** section.

   In your terminal, **set the `BOUNDARY_ADDR` environment variable** to the
   copied URL.

   ```shell-session
   $ export BOUNDARY_ADDR=<actual-boundary-address>
   ```

1. Log in with the administrator credentials you created when you deployed the
   HCP Boundary instance. Enter your password at the `Please enter the password
   (it will be hidden):` prompt.

   ```shell-session
   $ boundary authenticate password -auth-method-id $BOUNDARY_AUTH_METHOD_ID -login-name admin
   Please enter the password (it will be hidden):

   Authentication information:
     Account ID:      acctpw_FfOfCS1d5K
     Auth Method ID:  ampw_YfIUt060sp
     Expiration Time: Fri, 30 Sep 2022 11:25:48 MDT
     User ID:         u_RapeEBo5Uf
   
   The token was successfully stored in the chosen keyring and is not displayed here.
   ```

You are now logged into your HCP Boundary instance's **Global** scope using the
CLI. This is the default scope for all new Boundary clusters.

</Tab>
<Tab heading="Terraform" group="terraform">

To proceed with the Terraform workflow:

The following values are needed to set up the [Boundary Terraform
provider](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/boundary). The
`password_auth_method_login_name` and `password_auth_method_password` are
created when first [setting up HCP
Boundary](/boundary/tutorials/hcp-getting-started/hcp-getting-started-create), and the others can be
gathered from the HCP portal or the Boundary Admin Console UI.

- `addr` (from HCP portal)
- `auth_method_id` (from Boundary Admin Console UI)
- `password_auth_method_login_name` (from initial Boundary Cluster creation)
- `password_auth_method_password` (from initial Boundary Cluster creation)
- `scope_id` (global scope from Boundary Admin Console UI)

Locate these values and have them ready for setting up the Terraform config
files later on.

### Providers

To enable an OIDC auth method an administrator must first configure their OIDC
provider, and then Boundary. The administrator registers Boundary as a new
client with their OIDC provider by providing some values unique to their
Boundary deployment. The administrator then configures Boundary with unique
client information provided by their OIDC provider during registration. These
values must match up for OIDC to work.

The administrator will need to provide a list of Boundary callback URLs when
configuring the OIDC provider. The callback URLs route to one of the controllers
and must begin with 'https', unless Boundary is in dev mode, where the URLs will
route to localhost.

Many OIDC providers can be integrated with Boundary. This tutorial demonstrates
working with Auth0, a popular provider for OIDC.

### Get setup with Auth0

A developer account and sample application are required to setup Auth0 as an OIDC
provider for Boundary. If you don't have a developer account, [sign up for
Auth0](https://auth0.com/signup). It is recommended to use a personal account
for testing, and to avoid integrating an account that might already be
associated with Auth0. A free account is suitable for testing OIDC integration
with Boundary.

### Create a user

First, create an Auth0 user that will be permitted to log into the application
that authorizes Boundary.

1. Once signed up, the Auth0 Dashboard is displayed. Navigate to the **User
   Management** view using the sidebar on the left side of the page.

   ![Auth0 Dashboard](/img/boundary/oidc/oidc-auth0-dashboard-0.png)

1. Click **+ Create User**.

   ![Auth0 Dashboard](/img/boundary/oidc/oidc-auth0-create-user-0.png)

1. Enter the user _Email_ and _Password_, then Click **Create**.

   ![Auth0 Dashboard](/img/boundary/oidc/oidc-auth0-create-user-1.png)

1. The new user's details should be displayed in the User Management Dashboard.

   ![Auth0 Dashboard](/img/boundary/oidc/oidc-auth0-create-user-2.png)

1. If using Terraform to provision Boundary, copy the **user_id** value under
   the _Identity Provider Attributes_ section. Save this value for defining the
   `oidc_user` `subject` later on.

   ![Auth0 Dashboard](/img/boundary/oidc/oidc-auth0-create-user-3.png)

### Create an application

An [application](https://auth0.com/docs/applications) is what authorizes Auth0
users added in the previous step to connect with Boundary. After creating an
application, its configuration details are used to add the OIDC auth method to
Boundary.

1. Navigate to the **Applications** view using the sidebar on the left side of
   the page.

1. From the Applications view, click the **+ Create Application** button.

   ![Auth0 Create Application](/img/boundary/oidc/oidc-auth0-dashboard-create-0.png)

1. Select **Regular Web Application** and give your application a name. This
   tutorial calls the application _Boundary OIDC Test_. Click **Create**.

   ![Auth0 Name Web Application](/img/boundary/oidc/oidc-auth0-dashboard-create-1.png)

1. Once created the browser should redirect to the application settings view. If
   not, visit **Applications** using the navigation bar on the left, select the new
   application and visit its **Settings** view.

   Scroll down to the **Application URIs** section.

   <Variant slug="boundary-deploy" option="hcp">

   Create a callback URL by entering the HCP Boundary cluster address, followed
   by `/v1/auth-methods/oidc:authenticate:callback` under the _Allowed Callback
   URLs_ field. For example,
   `https://e58fe114-7624-431c-994d-b6670e90b03J.boundary.hashicorp.cloud/v1/auth-methods/oidc:authenticate:callback`.

   ```plaintext
   https://BOUNDARY_ADDR/v1/auth-methods/oidc:authenticate:callback
   ```

   This value is also printed later on when creating the OIDC method with the
   Boundary CLI, but is fixed and can be entered into the Auth0 provider
   settings ahead of time.

   Lastly, locate the _Allowed Logout URLs_ section directly below, and enter
   the HCP Boundary Cluster address followed by `:3000` (such as
   `https://e58fe114-7624-431c-994d-b6670e90b03J.boundary.hashicorp.cloud:3000`)

   ```plaintext
   https://BOUNDARY_ADDR:3000
   ```

   Make sure your config matches the image shown below.

   ![Auth0 Application Settings](/img/boundary/oidc/oidc-auth0-app-settings-hcp.png)
   
   </Variant>
   <Variant slug="boundary-deploy" option="dev">

   Paste the following callback URL under the _Allowed Callback URLs_ field.

   ```plaintext
   http://localhost:9200/v1/auth-methods/oidc:authenticate:callback
   ```

   This value is also printed later on when creating the OIDC method with the
   Boundary CLI, but is fixed and can be entered into the Auth0 provider
   settings ahead of time.

   Lastly, locate the _Allowed Logout URLs_ section directly below, and enter
   `http://localhost:3000` because Boundary is running in dev mode.

   Make sure your config matches the image shown below.

   ![Auth0 Application Settings](/img/boundary/oidc/oidc-auth0-app-settings-1.png)

   </Variant>

1. Three important values are listed at the top of the **Settings** view for use
   when configuring OIDC with Boundary.

   - Domain
   - Client ID
   - Client Secret

   Keep this page open to refer to these values in the next steps.

   ![Auth0 Application Settings](/img/boundary/oidc/oidc-auth0-app-settings-0.png)

## Auth method creation

Authentication is the process of establishing a user's identity. The user
initiates this process by selecting an auth method.

When the user selects an OIDC auth method, the user's client sends a request to
the system and includes additional data about the client itself. The system then
returns two URLs: an OIDC authentication request URL and a Boundary token
request URL.

If the user's client is a web browser, the client stores the Boundary token
request URL in local storage then redirects the page to the OIDC authentication
request URL. If the user's client is not a web browser, the client opens a web
browser to the OIDC authentication request URL and begins polling the Boundary
token request URL.

The user interacts with the OIDC provider to prove their identity using the
browser window opened by the user's client. Once the OIDC provider has
authenticated the user's identity, it redirects the browser window back to
Boundary. The user's client then retrieves a Boundary token from the request
URL.

To get started, an authentication method must be created for the provider of
choice.

### Create auth method for the provider

To set up a new auth method for your provider you will need the following from
your provider's application settings:

- issuer
- client-id
- client-secret

Auth methods can be created using the Admin Console UI, CLI, or using Terraform.

<Tabs>
<Tab heading="Admin Console" group="admin">


The Boundary Admin Console provides a UI for creating and managing OIDC
resources, including auth methods.

<Variant slug="boundary-deploy" option="hcp">

Open the Admin Console UI by entering your HCP Boundary Cluster URL into a
browser (such as
`https://e58fe114-7624-431c-994d-b6670e90b03J.boundary.hashicorp.cloud`).

Enter the admin username and password you created when you deployed the new
instance and click **Authenticate**.

</Variant>
<Variant slug="boundary-deploy" option="dev">

Open the Admin Console UI by entering the Dev Controller URL of
`http://localhost:9200` into a browser.

Enter the admin username `admin` and password `password` and click
**Authenticate**.

</Variant>

![Admin UI Login](/img/boundary/boundary-ui-login-hcp_light.png#light-theme-only)
![Admin UI Login](/img/boundary/boundary-ui-login-hcp_dark.png#dark-theme-only)

For **Auth0**, these settings map to the following:

- `issuer` -> _Domain_
- `client-id` -> _Client ID_
- `client-secret` -> _Client Secret_

With these values you gathered from the Auth0 application settings above a new
OIDC auth method can be created.

Start by navigating to the Auth Methods settings view using the menu on the left
side of the Admin Console. Select **New** and click **OIDC**.

![Admin Console New Auth Method](/img/boundary/oidc/admin-new-oidc-auth_light.png#light-theme-only)
![Admin Console New Auth Method](/img/boundary/oidc/admin-new-oidc-auth_dark.png#dark-theme-only)

Fill out the form details using the settings gathered from the Auth0 application
settings.

![Admin Console Auth Method Details](/img/boundary/oidc/admin-new-oidc-auth-form_light.png#light-theme-only)
![Admin Console Auth Method Details](/img/boundary/oidc/admin-new-oidc-auth-form_dark.png#dark-theme-only)

These include:

- Name (_Example: `Auth0`_)
- Description (_Example: `Auth0 OIDC test auth method`_)
- Issuer (_Example: `https://dev-1vdl8c0q.us.auth0.com/`_) **Ensure the Issuer has a trailing `/` at the end**
- Client ID (_Example: `zbaJLTZh3n14WqSV7qQ9onuIVRDaZdzz`_)
- Client Secret (_Example: `t35c9NNw1aZ8haQKYJjCL0lauNOSp5UNPovUJXo8Ea2sPZAR1DszEowX-5-lg-Xr`_)

<Variant slug="boundary-deploy" option="hcp">

Additionally, set the **Max Age** and **API URL Prefix**. The Max Age is set to
`0`, while the API URL Prefix is set to the HCP Boundary Cluster URL (for
example,
`https://e58fe114-7624-431c-994d-b6670e90b03J.boundary.hashicorp.cloud`)

- Max Age: `0`
- API URL Prefix: `https://BOUNDARY_ADDR`

<Tip title="Max Age">

The _Max Age_ property defines the amount of time since the user's last
authentication that must pass before the user must log in again. For this
demonstration, it will prevent any existing Auth0 accounts currently
authenticated in the browser from being used when the authentication is
performed.

</Tip>


<Tip title="API URL Prefix">

The _API URL Prefix_ is used for actions like token retrieval and
redirection.

</Tip>

</Variant>
<Variant slug="boundary-deploy" option="dev">

Additionally, set the **Max Age** and **API URL Prefix** as follows:

- Max Age: `0`
- API URL Prefix: `http://localhost:9200`

<Tip title="Max Age">

The _Max Age_ property defines the amount of time since the user's last
authentication that must pass before the user must log in again. For this
demonstration, it will prevent any existing Auth0 accounts currently
authenticated in the browser from being used when the authentication is
performed.

</Tip>


<Tip title="API URL Prefix">

The _API URL Prefix_ is set to `http://localhost:9200` because Boundary is
running in dev mode. This URL is used for actions like token retrieval and
redirection.

</Tip>

</Variant>

Once the form is completed, click **Save**.

With the new auth method created, an allowed signing algorithm can be added.

Click **Edit Form** for the new auth method and scroll down to the **Signing
Algorithms** section. Ensure that **RS256** is selected and click **Add**.

Once added, **Save** the form.

The new authentication method has now been created. To the right of the new auth
method, notice the state is set to _Inactive_. Before it can be used the new
auth method must be switched to an active state.

Next we will review the available authentication states and activate the new
OIDC auth method.

<Note title="Troubleshooting">

If unable to save the auth method, ensure that the **Issuer** has a trailing `/` at the end of the URL.

</Note>

</Tab>
<Tab heading="CLI" group="cli">


Start by ensuring you are **logged in to Boundary as the admin user.**

For **Auth0**, these settings map to the following:

- `issuer` -> _Domain_
- `client-id` -> _Client ID_
- `client-secret` -> _Client Secret_

With these values you gathered from the Auth0 application settings above a new
OIDC auth method can be created.

Start by setting the Client ID, Client Secret, and Issuer URL as environment variables.

```shell-session
$ export CLIENT_ID="<COPIED-CLIENT-ID>"; \
export CLIENT_SECRET="<COPIED-CLIENT-SECRET>"; \
export ISSUER_URL="<COPIED-DOMAIN>"
```

**Example:**

<CodeBlockConfig hideClipboard>

```shell-session
$ export CLIENT_ID="zaxJLTZh3n14WqSQ7qQ9onuIVRDaZdzz"; \
export CLIENT_SECRET="t35c9NNw1aZ8haEKFJbJF0lauMOSp5UNPovUJXo8Ea2sPZAR1DszEowX-6-lg-Xr"; \
export ISSUER_URL="dev-1sdl8c0z.us.auth0.com"
```

</CodeBlockConfig>

These values will be passed to Boundary when creating the new OIDC auth method.

<Note>

 The `api-url-prefix` must be set to the URL of your Boundary
cluster. Select **HCP** or **Dev mode** to see an example.

</Note>

<Variant slug="boundary-deploy" option="hcp">

For HCP the `api-url-prefix` is set to the HCP cluster's address found in the
HCP cloud portal. This value is identical to the `BOUNDARY_ADDR` environment
variable set when [logging in to the CLI](#get-setup) (for example,
`https://e58fe114-7624-431c-994d-b6670e90b03J.boundary.hashicorp.cloud`). The
following example passes this shell variable to the `boundary auth-methods
create oidc` command, but the cluster address can also be passed directly.

```shell-session
$ boundary auth-methods create oidc \
  -issuer "https://$ISSUER_URL" \
  -client-id "$CLIENT_ID" \
  -client-secret "$CLIENT_SECRET" \
  -signing-algorithm RS256 \
  -api-url-prefix "$BOUNDARY_ADDR" \
  -name "auth0"
```

- The `signing-algorithm` is commonly set to `RS256`.

- The `api-url-prefix` is used by the OIDC provider in the authentication flow,

The new authentication method has now been created. Under the **Attributes**
output, notice the **state** is set to _inactive_. Before it can be used the new
auth method must be switched to an active state.

**Copy the new OIDC Auth Method ID from the output.**

Next we will review the available authentication states and activate the new
OIDC auth method.

</Tab>
<Tab heading="Terraform" group="terraform">


Begin by creating a working directory to store the Terraform configuration file
and changing into that directory. This tutorial will work out of the user's
`HOME` directory.

```shell-session
$ mkdir learn-boundary-oidc && cd learn-boundary-oidc/
```

Next, create a Terraform configuration file called `main.tf`.

```shell-session
$ touch main.tf
```

Open the `main.tf` file in your code editor and add the base Boundary provider
configuration below. The `1.0.2` version or above is required to support OIDC.
An `output` value is included to print the oidc auth method id when Terraform
applies the configuration.

The initial setup should set the boundary provider to match Boundary's
authentication configuration so that Terraform can authenticate to Boundary.
These settings are discussed in the [Get Setup](#get-setup) section.

<Variant slug="boundary-deploy" option="hcp">

Copy the following configuration, but update the `addr`, `auth_method_id`,
`password_auth_method_login_name`, and `password_auth_method_password` with the
correct values for your Boundary org. 

- `addr` is the `BOUNDARY_ADDR` copied from the HCP portal. 
- `auth_method_id` is for the `password` auth method and can be gathered from
  the Boundary Admin Console UI. 
- `password_auth_method_login_name` and `password_auth_method_password` were
  created upon initial setup of the HCP Boundary cluster.

<CodeBlockConfig filename="learn-boundary-oidc/main.tf">

```hcl
terraform {

    boundary = {
      source  = "hashicorp/boundary"

Next, Boundary Terraform resources will be used to set up the provider of
choice.

For **Auth0**, these settings map to the following:

- `issuer` -> _Domain_
- `client-id` -> _Client ID_
- `client-secret` -> _Client Secret_
- `subject` -> _user_id_

With these values you gathered from the [Auth0 application settings](#create-an-application) a new
OIDC auth method can be created.

The Terraform Boundary provider enables OIDC using the
`boundary_auth_method_oidc` and `boundary_account_oidc` resources.

The
[`boundary_auth_method_oidc`](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/boundary/latest/docs/resources/auth_method_oidc)
resource uses the following attributes to configure a new auth method:

<CodeBlockConfig hideClipboard>

```plainText
resource "boundary_auth_method_oidc" "name" {
  name                = (String)
  description         = (String)
  scope_id            = (String)
  issuer              = (String)
  client_id           = (String)
  client_secret       = (String)
  signing_algorithms  = (List of String)
  api_url_prefix      = (String)
}
```

</CodeBlockConfig>

- The `scope_id` is the global scope ID. For HCP this is gathered from the
  Boundary Admin Console UI, or is `o_1234567890` if using Boundary's Dev mode.
- The `issuer` was gathered from the provider, and should be prefixed by `https://`
- The `client_id` was gathered from the provider
- The `client_secret` was gathered from the provider
- The `signing_algorithms` are defined by the provider's issued tokens, and will
  usually include RS256
- The `api_url_prefix` is used when generating callback urls and corresponds to
  an address where the controller is reachable by the provider. For HCP Boundary
  this is the Boundary Cluster URL found in the HCP portal (such as
  `https://e58fe114-7624-431c-994d-b6670e90b03J.boundary.hashicorp.cloud`). For
  dev mode this is `http://localhost:9200`

The
[`boundary_account_oidc`](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/boundary/latest/docs/resources/account_oidc)
resource uses the following attributes to configure a new auth method:

<CodeBlockConfig hideClipboard>

```plainText
resource "boundary_account_oidc" "name" {
  name           = (String)
  description    = (String)
  auth_method_id = (String)
  issuer         = (String)
  subject        = (String)
}
```

</CodeBlockConfig>

- The `auth_method_id` is defined by the `boundary_auth_method_oidc` resource,
  and can be accessed using the named scope id, like
  `boundary_auth_meethod_oidc.name.id`
- The `issuer` was gathered from the provider, and should be prefixed by `https://`
- The `subject` maps to the user ID, and was gathered from the provider when
  creating a user

Add these two resources into your `main.tf` file. The entire file contents are
shown below.

<Variant slug="boundary-deploy" option="hcp">

**_Make sure the following values are updated_**:

- `addr` (from HCP portal)
- `auth_method_id` (from Boundary Admin Console UI)

## Authentication states

An OIDC auth method can be in one of several different states: Inactive, Active
Private, and Active Public. The current state of an OIDC auth method
affects how endpoints respond to requests and, in some cases, whether access to
an endpoint requires authentication.

### State change operations

- _MakeInactive_ transitions an OIDC auth method from either the Active Private
  or the Active Public state into the Inactive state.
- _MakePrivate_ transitions an OIDC auth method from either the Inactive or the
  Active Public state into the Active Private state. If transitioning from the
  Inactive state, the transition will only succeed if the configuration is
  valid.
- _MakePublic_ transitions an OIDC auth method from either the Inactive or the
  Active Private state into the Active Public state. If transitioning from the
  Inactive state, the transition will only succeed if the configuration is
  valid.

Three different states exist for an authentication method:

- `inactive` users can not authenticate with inactive auth methods and the inactive auth methods are not
  listed for unauthenticated users.
- `active-private` users can authenticate with active-private auth methods and active-private
  auth methods are not listed for unauthenticated users.
- `active-public` users can authenticate active-public auth methods and active-public auth methods are
  listed for unauthenticated users.

Before changing the state of an auth-method, Boundary will retrieve the
Providerâ€™s discovery document for the auth methodâ€™s issuer and attempt to
validate the auth-methodâ€™s configuration against this published information. If
Boundary is unable to validate the configuration an error is returned and the
state change is not made.

If a change is made from active-public or active-private to inactive, all
in-flight authentications will succeed unless the auth methodâ€™s configuration is
modified while the request is in-flight.

When changing an auth method's state using `boundary auth-methods change-state`
the `-disable-discovered-config-validation` flag is used to disable validation
against the providerâ€™s published discovery document. This allows for the very
rare occurrence when the Provider has published an invalid discovery document.

### Activate the OIDC auth method

Now that a new OIDC method has been created, it can be activated and assigned as
the default login type for the global scope.

Currently the login type is set as inactive, and won't allow authentication.

```shell-session
$ boundary authenticate oidc -auth-method-id amoidc_oHt4HQFCrN
Error from controller when performing authentication start

Error information:
  Kind:                Internal
  Message:             authmethod_service.(Service).authenticateOidcStart: Error generating parameters for starting the OIDC flow.: unknown: error #500
  Status:              500
  context:             Error from controller when performing authentication start
```

Auth methods can be activated using the Admin Console UI, CLI, or using Terraform.

<Tabs>
<Tab heading="Admin Console" group="admin">

Before the new auth method will be allowed it must be set to an active state.

Under the settings for the new auth method, select **Inactive** from the menu in
the upper-right side of the page and change its state by clicking **Public**.

The login type is now allowed.

### Set OIDC as primary login

Global and organization scopes may have auth methods in Boundary, and each scope
has one primary auth-method ID. Boundary will automatically create a user upon
first successful authentication using the scopeâ€™s primary auth method, which will
be used by scopes with only one auth method available.

When [migrating the database](/boundary/tutorials/oss-configuration/upgrade-version), Boundary
will produce a log of any auth methods which resulted in no primary auth method
being set for the scope.

Set the new OIDC auth method as the primary auth method for the global scope.

Under the settings for the new auth method, select **Manage** from the menu in
the upper-right side of the page.

A confirmation window will be displayed to inform you that new users that sign
in using OIDC will automatically be added to the new auth method. Select **OK** to
continue.

Now try authenticating using the newly created OIDC auth method.

Select the **admin** user menu in the top-right corner of the page and select
**Deauthenticate**.

Next, select the new auth method called **Auth0**, and click **Authenticate**.

![Admin Console Auth0](/img/boundary/oidc/admin-auth0-authenticate_light.png#light-theme-only)
![Admin Console Auth0](/img/boundary/oidc/admin-auth0-authenticate_dark.png#dark-theme-only)

A browser tab should automatically open and prompt you to log in with your Auth0
user account credentials.

![Auth0 Application Login](/img/boundary/oidc/oidc-auth0-login.png)

After successful authentication you are automatically redirected to the Admin
Console. Notice the restricted permissions for this new user, which can be
updated and assigned using
[Roles](/boundary/docs/concepts/domain-model/roles) and
[Groups](/boundary/docs/concepts/domain-model/groups).

If you were to log back into the Admin Console as the admin user, you would

If you attempt to enable the the auth method by updating its state to public, an error will be produced.

```shell-session
$ boundary auth-methods change-state oidc -id amoidc_oHt4HQFCrN -state active-public
Error from controller when performing change-state on oidc-type auth method

Error information:

Notice the 500 error, and the discrepancy between the expected URLs. The issuer
URL needs to be updated to include a `/` at the end.

Additionally, set the `-max-age` option to `0`, which will force the user to
re-authenticate if they are already logged in with the current browser session.

And the login type will now allow be allowed.

### Set OIDC as primary login

Global and organization scopes may have auth methods in Boundary, and each scope
has one primary auth-method ID. Boundary will automatically create a user upon
first successful authentication using the scopeâ€™s primary auth method, which will
be used by scopes with only one auth method available.

When [migrating the database](/boundary/tutorials/oss-configuration/upgrade-version), Boundary
will produce a log of any auth methods which resulted in no primary auth method
being set for the scope.

Set the new OIDC auth method as the primary auth method for the global scope.

```shell-session
$ boundary scopes update -primary-auth-method-id amoidc_q7jAdI1QgA -id global

Scope information:

```

Now try authenticating using the newly created OIDC auth method.

```shell-session
$ boundary authenticate oidc -auth-method-id amoidc_q7jAdI1QgA
Opening returned authentication URL in your browser...

```

A browser tab should automatically open and prompt you to log in with your Auth0
user account credentials.

After successful authentication, return to your terminal and notice the
Authentication information that is printed.

```shell-session
$ boundary authenticate oidc -auth-method-id amoidc_q7jAdI1QgA
Opening returned authentication URL in your browser...

Authentication information:
  Account ID:      acctoidc_oztPFBFesH

  User ID:         u_JCRQP3ID7l

The token was successfully stored in the chosen keyring and is not displayed here.
```

</Tab>
<Tab heading="Terraform" group="terraform">

Auth methods must be updated to an active state before they can be used.

The state of the new auth method can be checked using the read operation. First,
ensure you are logged in as the admin user.

```shell-session
$ boundary authenticate password -auth-method-id ampw_1234567890 -login-name admin
Please enter the password (it will be hidden): <password>

Authentication information:
  Account ID:      apw_DZRvFzmb0Y

  User ID:         u_1234567890

The token was successfully stored in the chosen keyring and is not displayed here.
```

Next read the auth method details. Use the `auth-method-id` you copied from the
`terraform apply` output.

```shell-session
$ boundary auth-methods read -id amoidc_AliCbVihqv

    signing_algorithms: [RS256]
    state:              active-public
```

Notice at the bottom of the output that the login state is already set to
`active-public`.

It's important to be aware that using Terraform to provision an auth method will
set the state to active by default, unless otherwise defined. The `state`
attribute can be used on the `boundary_auth_method_oidc` resource to set an auth
method to `active-private` or `inactive`.

Now that the auth method state has been verified, the primary login type can be
defined for the global scope.

### Set OIDC as primary login

Global and organization scopes may have auth methods in Boundary, and each scope
has one primary auth-method ID. Boundary will automatically create a user upon
first successful authentication using the scopeâ€™s primary auth method, which will
be used by scopes with only one auth method available.

When [migrating the database](/boundary/tutorials/oss-configuration/upgrade-version), Boundary
will produce a log of any auth methods which have more than one auth method
which resulted in no primary auth method being set for the Scope.

Make three updates to the `boundary_auth_method_oidc` resource in the `main.tf`
file:

- Set the auth method's `state` to `active-public` for clarity
- Set the new OIDC auth method as the primary auth method for the global scope
  by setting the `is_primary_for_scope` attribute
- Set the `-max-age` option to `0`, which will force the user to re-authenticate
  if they are already logged in with the current browser session.

Below is an example. Update your `main.tf` file accordingly.

```hcl
resource "boundary_auth_method_oidc" "provider" {
  name                 = "Auth0"
  description          = "OIDC auth method for Auth0"
  scope_id             = "o_1234567890"
  issuer             = "https://dev-1vdl8c0q.us.auth0.com/"
  client_id          = "zbaJLTZh3n14WqSV7qQ9onuIVRDaZdzx"
  client_secret      = "t35c9NNw1aZ8haQKYJjCL0lauNOSp5UNPovUJXo8Ea2sPZAR1DszEowX-5-lg-Xr"
  signing_algorithms = ["RS256"]
  api_url_prefix     = "http://localhost:9200"
  is_primary_for_scope = true
  state = "active-public"
  max_age = 0
}
```

Apply the updated configuration. Enter `yes` when prompted.

```shell-session
$ terraform apply

## Authenticate using OIDC

With the OIDC provider configured, Boundary users can authenticate using the
CLI, Admin Console or Boundary Desktop app. Boundary administrators will usually
follow a CLI or Admin Console workflow, while clients and end-users can use the
CLI or Desktop application.

<Tabs>
<Tab heading="Desktop App" group="desktop">


The [Boundary Desktop](/boundary/tutorials/oss-getting-started/oss-getting-started-desktop-app)
app is currently available for MacOS and Windows users.

<Note>

Ensure that the latest version of the Boundary Desktop app is installed from
the [releases](https://releases.hashicorp.com/boundary-desktop/) page before
attempting to login with OIDC. The minimum version of the app allowing OIDC
login is [1.0.0](https://releases.hashicorp.com/boundary-desktop/1.0.0/).

</Note>

1. Launch the Boundary Desktop app and enter the Boundary Cluster URL. 

   <Variant slug="boundary-deploy" option="hcp">
   
   The Cluster URL was copied from the HCP portal, such as
   `https://e58fe114-7624-431c-994d-b6670e90b03J.boundary.hashicorp.cloud`.
   Click **Submit**.

   ![Desktop Cluster URL](/img/boundary/desktop/desktop-cluster-url_dark.png#dark-theme-only)

   </Variant>

1. Select **Auth0** and click **Authenticate**.

1. A browser window should launch and prompt for your provider's user
   credentials. You may see an "Authentication Pending" message, and can click
   the "Retry" button to force a new authentication tab to open.

   ![Desktop Application Login](/img/boundary/oidc/desktop-auth-pending.png)

   Submit your OIDC provider user credentials. Below is an example of
   authenticating using Auth0.

   ![Desktop Application Login](/img/boundary/oidc/oidc-auth0-login.png)

1. You should receive a "Successful Authentication" message.

   ![Desktop Successful Auth](/img/boundary/oidc/admin-successful-auth_light.png#light-theme-only)
   ![Desktop Successful Auth](/img/boundary/oidc/admin-successful-auth_dark.png#dark-theme-only)

   Once authenticated, open the Boundary Desktop app again and verify the
   authenticated user in the upper-right corner of the application window.

   It is expected for this user to be unprivileged, and to be denied access to
   view targets and sessions. The OIDC user could be updated to include new
   privileges if an admin user [assigns it to a
   role](/boundary/tutorials/oss-administration/oss-manage-roles).

1. Next, enter your Auth0 user credentials and click **Continue**.

   ![Auth0 Application Login](/img/boundary/oidc/admin-console-2.png)

1. You should receive a "Successful Authentication" message and automatically be
   redirected to the Admin Console. If you are not redirected, check to make
   sure your browser is not blocking pop-ups from `http://localhost:9200`, or
   allow pop-ups temporarily.

1. Once authenticated, navigate to the **Auth Methods** view on the left, and
   notice the `OIDC` Type and ID used when setting up the auth method. Explore
   the other views and notice what this user has access to view and not view.
   The OIDC user could be updated to include new privileges if an admin user
   [assigns it to a role](/boundary/tutorials/oss-administration/oss-manage-roles).

   You have now completed OIDC integration with the Admin Console.

The `boundary authenticate oidc` command will launch a browser session to enable
authentication using the configured provider.

```shell-session
$ boundary authenticate oidc -auth-method-id amoidc_q7jAdI1QgA

```

The provider's login page should open in a browser tab, prompting for the username
and password for the account used to configure the Boundary OIDC Test
application. Below is an example of the Auth0 provider's login prompt.

![Auth0 Application Login](/img/boundary/oidc/oidc-auth0-login.png)

<Warning>

**Trouble logging in?** If you receive an _Unsuccessful authentication_
message from Boundary, try logging out of the provider in your browser, then run
`boundary authenticate oidc` again and re-authenticate. This is especially
important if you created a new provider user in the [Create a
user](#create-a-user) section. Ensure you are logging in as the correct user.

</Warning>

After logging in your terminal should confirm the Account and User IDs.

```shell-session
$ boundary authenticate oidc -auth-method-id amoidc_q7jAdI1QgA
Opening returned authentication URL in your browser...

The token was successfully stored in the chosen keyring and is not displayed here.
```

The user is now authenticated using OIDC. Listing various scope items would show
this user is not able to access most resources by default. The OIDC user could
be updated to include new privileges if an admin user [assigns it to a
role](/boundary/tutorials/oss-administration/oss-manage-roles).

You have now completed OIDC integration using the CLI.
