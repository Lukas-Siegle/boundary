Boundary dev mode was a convenient way to explore and test. The next step is to
deploy a non-dev highly available (HA) environment.

The following diagram shows a general architecture on Amazon Web Services (AWS).

You should run a minimum of 3 controllers and 3 workers for fault tolerance.

~> For the complete guide, refer to the Boundary [High Availability
Install](/boundary/docs/oss/installing/high-availability)
documentation. Find Terraform files at [Boundary AWS Reference Architecture
GitHub repository](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary-reference-architecture)
to deploy a cluster as shown in the diagram. 

-> Boundary Docker image
([`hashicorp/boundary`](https://hub.docker.com/r/hashicorp/boundary)) is also
available. The Dockerfile can be found in the [GitHub
repository](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary/blob/main/Dockerfile).
