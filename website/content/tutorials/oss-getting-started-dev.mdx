In this tutorial, you will start Boundary in dev mode and authenticate as the
admin user.

Boundary provides a dev mode to enable quick testing and exploration. Dev mode
provides admin credentials for password authentication.

## Prerequisites

1. [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) is installed
1. A route to download the [Postgres Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/_/postgres) image or a local image cached
1. A [Boundary binary](/boundary/install/) in your `PATH`

<InteractiveLabCallout />

## Start a dev environment

A deployment of a highly available (HA) Boundary service requires multiple
**controllers** and **workers** to construct a cluster.

![Boundary components](/img/boundary/boundary-components-min.png)

- **Controllers** are responsible for understanding configuration,
  authenticating and authorizing users, and serving user API requests (e.g. to
  initiate a session).

- Boundary clusters require an accessible **key management service** (KMS) and
  **database** shared by controllers. Boundary's database maintains the state of
  Boundary's resources, identities, and access policies. Boundary's KMS is
  customer-defined and serves as Boundary's root-of-trust for at-rest and
  in-transit encryption.

- **Workers** are responsible for the actual session recording/proxying
  capability and other tasks that involve storage.

Dev mode brings up a fully functioning instance of Boundary which includes:

- A controller server
- A worker server
- A Postgres database

These components are ephemeral; therefore, data is not persisted and convenient
for quick testing.

<Warning>

Dev mode is not suitable for production environments.

</Warning>

Check the help message for `boundary dev` command.

```shell-session
$ boundary dev -h
```

There are optional flags available to configure Boundary environment through the
command line.

<CodeBlockConfig hideClipboard>

```shell-session
Usage: boundary dev [options]

  Start a dev environment:

      $ boundary dev

  For a full list of examples, refer to the [documentation](/boundary/docs/configuration).

Connection Options:

  -addr=<string>
      Address of the Boundary controller, as a complete URL (for example, 
      https://boundary.example.com:9200). The address can also be specified via the
      BOUNDARY_ADDR environment variable.

  -ca-cert=<string>
      Path on the local disk to a single PEM-encoded CA certificate to
      verify the controller or worker server's SSL certificate. This path
      takes precedence over -ca-path. It can also be specified via the
      BOUNDARY_CACERT environment variable.

  -ca-path=<string>
      Path on the local disk to a directory of PEM-encoded CA certificates to
      verify the SSL certificate of the controller. This path can also be specified
      via the BOUNDARY_CAPATH environment variable.

<Accordion heading='Troubleshooting "Error creating dev database container" on Windows' collapse>

<Warning>

On Windows systems you may encounter the following error when running
`boundary dev`:

</Warning>

<CodeBlockConfig hideClipboard>

```shell-session
$ boundary dev

Error creating dev database container: unable to start dev database with dialect postgres: could not start resource: : Post "http://localhost:2375/images/create?fromImage=postgres&tag=12": dial tcp [::1]:2375: connectex: No connection could be made because the target machine actively refused it.
```

</CodeBlockConfig>

<Warning>

If the error is similar to the one printed above, the Docker daemon may need
to be exposed on port 2375 without TLS.

</Warning>

Open Docker Desktop, and navigate to the **Settings** panel by clicking on the gear
icon at the top-right of the screen.

Under **General** settings, click the checkbox next to _Expose deamon on
tcp://localhost:2375 without TLS_ to enable the setting. Then click **Apply &
Restart** to restart Docker Desktop. The screenshot below shows the setting that
should be enabled.

![](/img/boundary/boundary-docker-expose-daemon-0.png)

After Docker Desktop restarts, attempt running `boundary dev` again.

</Accordion>

Boundary starts in dev mode with default authentication credentials and
a set of pre-defined [resources](/boundary/docs/concepts/domain-model).

These admin credentials enable you to log in the Boundary console.

- Generated Auth Method Id: `ampw_1234567890`
- Generated Auth Method Login Name: `admin`
- Generated Auth Method Password: `password`

-> The default login name and password can be overwritten with `-login-name` and
`-password` flags (e.g. `boundary dev -login-name="dev-admin" -password="p@ssw0rd"`).

## Login to the Boundary console

You can authenticate to the Boundary console via the Admin console or the CLI.

<Tabs>
<Tab heading="Admin console">


1. In a browser window, navigate to the Boundary Admin console at `http://127.0.0.1:9200`

   This launches the Boundary Admin console.

   ![](/img/boundary/boundary-ui-login.png)

1. Enter `admin` in the **Username** field.

   This is the _Generated Auth Method Login Name_.

1. Enter `password` in the **Password** field.

   This is the _Generated Auth Method Password_.

1. Click **Authenticate**.

   You are presented with the _global_ scope, which contains the _Generated org scope_
   with the ID `o_1234567890`.

   ![Organizations](/img/boundary/boundary-ui-org.png)

</Tab>


<Tab heading="CLI command">


Display the help message for `boundary authenticate` command.

```shell-session
$ boundary authenticate help

Usage: boundary authenticate [sub command] [options] [args]

  This command authenticates the Boundary commandline client using a specified auth method. Examples:

    Authenticate with password auth method:

      $ boundary authenticate password -auth-method-id ampw_1234567890 -login-name foo

  Please see the auth method subcommand help for detailed usage information.

Subcommands:
    password    Invoke the password auth method to authenticate with Boundary
```

The CLI supports password authentication.

Authenticate with the password method using `auth-method-id` and `login-name`. If using the default dev environment, the password will be `password`.

```shell-session
$ boundary authenticate password \
    -auth-method-id=ampw_1234567890 \
    -login-name=admin
```

- The `auth-method-id` is the Generated Auth Method Id: `ampw_1234567890`
- The `login-name` is the Generated Auth Method Login Name: `admin`
- The `password` is the Generated Auth Method Password: `password`

**Example output:**

<CodeBlockConfig hideClipboard>

```shell-session
Authentication information:
  Account ID:      acctpw_1234567890
  Auth Method ID:  ampw_1234567890
  Expiration Time: Mon, 13 Dec 2021 11:20:22 MST
  User ID:         u_1234567890

The token was successfully stored in the chosen keyring and is not displayed here.
```

</CodeBlockConfig>

The login saves a token to the KMS running on the system. Future requests use
this token to authenticate until it expires.

You can also utilize Boundary's environment variables to make authentication
simpler.

Export the following environment variables:

- `BOUNDARY_ADDR`: The controller address, `http://127.0.0.1:9200` in dev mode
- `BOUNDARY_AUTH_METHOD_ID`: The generated password auth method ID,
  `ampw_1234567890` in dev mode

```shell-session
$ export BOUNDARY_ADDR="http://127.0.0.1:9200"
```

```shell-session
$ export BOUNDARY_AUTH_METHOD_ID="ampw_1234567890"
```

Log into the CLI as the admin user, providing the `admin` username and password
`password` when prompted.

```shell-session
$ boundary authenticate
Please enter the login name (it will be hidden):
Please enter the password (it will be hidden):
Authentication information:
  Account ID:      acctpw_VOeNSFX8pQ
  Auth Method ID:  ampw_wxzojlKJLN
  Expiration Time: Mon, 13 Feb 2023 12:35:32 MST
  User ID:         u_1vUkf5fPs9
The token was successfully stored in the chosen keyring and is not displayed here.
```

When using Boundary in the future, keep in mind that auth methods can be set up
at different scopes. To log into a differnt scope, you may need to set a
different `BOUNDARY_AUTH_METHOD_ID` shell variable, or pass it as the
`auth-method-id` option when executing `boundary authenticate`.

## Troubleshooting

Boundary clusters require an accessible **key management service** (KMS). An
error may occur if this service is not running.

-> If you are having problems logging in with `boundary authenticate`,
especially on Unix-like operating systems other than MacOS, you may be having
problems with your local key store. See the [Deploy and Login to
Boundary](/boundary/docs/getting-started/deploy-and-login)
page in Boundary's documentation for more details.

Click on the error message below for step-by-step solutions to continue the
Getting Started tutorials.

<Accordion heading="ERROR MESSAGE: Error reading auth token from system
credential store" collapse="true">


In a Unix shell this error implies that the freedesktop.org Secret Service
implementation is not available. To fix this issue you can either bypass the
keyring or enable the system KMS.

### Method 1: Bypass the keyring

The CLI can bypass the operating system's keyring manager by overriding the
keyring type and managing the token in the environment variable.

Set the `BOUNDARY_TOKEN` environment variable to the authentication token.

~> If you are using Boundary 0.9.1 or lower, use this command:

```shell-session
$ export BOUNDARY_TOKEN=$(boundary authenticate password \
  -auth-method-id=ampw_1234567890 \
  -login-name=admin \
  -password=password \
  -keyring-type=none \
  -format=json | jq -r ".item.attributes.token")
```

~> If you are using Boundary 0.10.0 or higher, use these commands:

```shell-session
$ export BOUNDARY_PASS=password
$ export BOUNDARY_TOKEN=$(boundary authenticate password \
  -auth-method-id=ampw_1234567890 \
  -login-name=admin \
  -password=env://BOUNDARY_PASS \
  -keyring-type=none \
  -format=json | jq -r ".item.attributes.token")
```


The keyring is bypassed by setting `keyring-type` to disabled (`none`). The
results are formatted to json `-format=json`, and parsed by `jq` for the `token`
value.

### Method 2: Enable the system KMS

You can fix this error by installing the `dbus-x11` and `gnome-keyring` packages
and manually invoking the keyring daemon.

On Ubuntu, install the `dbus-x11` and `gnome-keyring` packages.

```shell-session
$ sudo apt install dbus-x11 gnome-keyring
```

Create the variable `KEYRING_PASSWORD` with a password.

```shell-session
$ KEYRING_PASSWORD="FOOBAR\n"
```

~> You can prevent the password from being captured on the command line by
running the `gnome-keyring-daemon` command directly and entering in the password
when requested, followed by a newline (return) and an EOF (`Ctrl+D`).

Substitute `FOOBAR` with a password of your choice. Leave the `\n`.

Create a default keyring and unlock it with a password.

```shell-session
$ eval "$(printf '$KEYRING_PASSWORD' | gnome-keyring-daemon --unlock)"
```

Connect to the keyring daemon and initialize it with the same password.

```shell-session
$ eval "$(printf 'KEYRING_PASSWORD' | gnome-keyring-daemon --start)"
```

Run this in any shell where the Boundary CLI is invoked.

## Next steps

You started Boundary in dev mode and authenticated as the admin user. Next you
will manage resources using the [Boundary admin
console](/boundary/tutorials/oss-getting-started/oss-getting-started-console).
