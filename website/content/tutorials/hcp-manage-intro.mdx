The [Getting Started tutorials](/boundary/tutorials/hcp-getting-started) gave
you a tour of the Admin Console UI and examined different [Boundary
resources](/boundary/tutorials/hcp-getting-started/hcp-getting-started-console#boundary-resource-summary).

This sequence of tutorials demonstrates common resource management operations
for HCP Boundary. Complete the tutorials in sequential order to create the
complete set of resources shown in the diagram below.

![Resources](/img/boundary/diagram-resource-mgmt.png)

## Prerequisites

To complete this collection of tutorials, you need:

- A [Boundary binary](/boundary/install/) in your `PATH`.
  This tutorial uses the 0.12.0 version of Boundary.

- [Terraform 0.13.0 or greater](/terraform/tutorials/aws-get-started/install-cli) provides an
  optional workflow for these tutorials. The binary must be available in your
  `PATH`.

- Access to an HCP Boundary instance.

- A publicly accessible Ubuntu instance (for use as a target).

- An ssh key-pair that can be used to authenticate with the Ubuntu instance.
  
  Ensure that you have a local copy of the private key. This tutorial collection
  references the private key stored at an example path of
  `/Users/myuser/.ssh/ubuntu-private-key.pem`

<Note>

 Ubuntu is used in this tutorial for demonstration purposes only. You can
 [follow this
 guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/EC2_GetStarted.html)
 to create a publicly accessible EC2 instance to use for this tutorial. Ensure
 that you have access to the [key
 pair](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/get-set-up-for-amazon-ec2.html#create-a-key-pair)
 used to provision the instance. This key will be used later on to access the
 instance.

</Note>

To perform the tasks described in this collection, you need to have an HCP
Boundary environment. Refer to the [Getting
Started](/boundary/tutorials/hcp-getting-started/hcp-getting-started-intro) tutorial to set up HCP
Boundary.

## Get setup

Start by authenticating to Boundary using the **Cluster URL** copied from HCP,
and the **Auth Method ID** copied from the Admin Console UI. Export these values
as environment variables, and then log in.

First, open a shell session and export the `BOUNDARY_ADDR` environment variable.
Visit the [Create a Boundary Instance on HCP](/boundary/tutorials/hcp-getting-started/hcp-getting-started-create)
tutorial if you need to locate this value.

```shell-session
$ export BOUNDARY_ADDR=<HCP-CLUSTER-URL>
```

Now export the `BOUNDARY_AUTH_METHOD_ID` environment variable. Visit the [Getting Started
with the Admin Console](/boundary/tutorials/hcp-getting-started/hcp-getting-started-console) tutorial if you
need to locate this value.

```shell-session
$ export BOUNDARY_AUTH_METHOD_ID=<PASSWORD-AUTH-METHOD-ID>
```

Now log in to Boundary by specifying the **login name** and **password** for the
admin user for the HCP Boundary cluster. Visit the [Getting Started on
HCP](/boundary/tutorials/hcp-getting-started/hcp-getting-started-cloud) tutorial for a reminder of how this
user was set up. In the example below, the login name is `admin`. Enter `password`
at the `Please enter the password (it will be hidden):` prompt.

```shell-session
$ boundary authenticate
Please enter the login name (it will be hidden):
Please enter the password (it will be hidden):
Authentication information:
  Account ID:      acctpw_VOeNSFX8pQ
  Auth Method ID:  ampw_wxzojlKJLN
  Expiration Time: Mon, 13 Feb 2023 12:35:32 MST
  User ID:         u_1vUkf5fPs9
The token was successfully stored in the chosen keyring and is not displayed here.
```

Next, the [Manage Scopes](/boundary/tutorials/hcp-administration/hcp-manage-scopes) tutorial
demonstrates basic resource management and permissions modeling.
