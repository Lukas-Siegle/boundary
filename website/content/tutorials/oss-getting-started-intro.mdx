Boundary enables simple and secure access to dynamic infrastructure by:

- **Identity-based access controls:** Streamline just-in-time access to
privileged sessions (e.g. TCP, SSH, RDP) for users and applications. Tightly
control access permissions with extensible role-based access controls.

- **Access Automation:** Define your perimeter of resources, identities, and
access controls as code through Boundary's fully-instrumented Terraform
Provider, REST API, CLI, and SDK. Automate the discovery of new resources and
enforcement of existing policies as resources are provisioned.

- **Session Visibility:** Security administrators gain visibility into users
  accessing monitored targets. If necessary, the administrators can terminate
  the sessions from the admin console.

![Boundary Workflow](/img/boundary/boundary-workflow.png)

Traditional approaches like SSH bastion hosts or VPNs that require distributing
and managing credentials, configure network controls like firewalls, and expose
the private network.  Boundary provides a secure way to access hosts and
critical systems without having to manage credentials or expose your network.
