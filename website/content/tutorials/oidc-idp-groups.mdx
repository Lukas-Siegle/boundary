The OIDC authentication method allows Boundary users to delegate authentication
to an OIDC provider. This feature allows Boundary to integrate with popular
identity providers like Okta, cloud-hosted active directory services with an
OIDC frontend, and cloud identity management systems such as AWS IAM.

OIDC group membership can be automatically maintained using [managed
groups](/boundary/docs/concepts/domain-model/managed-groups).

This tutorial provides an example of managing identity provider (IdP) groups with Auth0, Okta, or
Azure Active Directory providers and managing those authentication methods from
HCP Boundary or Boundary's dev mode. Examples are provided for management via the CLI, Admin
Console, or Terraform. The managed group is then used as a principal within a
[role](/boundary/docs/concepts/domain-model/roles) to
assign an example grant.

### Manage IdP groups overview

1. [Get setup](#get-setup)
1. [Managed groups background](#managed-groups-background)
1. [Create a managed group](#create-a-managed-group)
1. [Create a role](#create-a-role)
1. [Verify permissions](#verify-permissions)

## Prerequisites

- This tutorial assumes the user has completed setting up an identity provider
  according to the instructions in the
  [Auth0](/boundary/tutorials/identity-management/oidc-auth0),
  [Okta](/boundary/tutorials/identity-management/oidc-okta), or [Azure
  AD](/boundary/tutorials/identity-management/oidc-azure) OIDC tutorials. This
  tutorial assumes the user has left the instance of HCP Boundary or Boundary's
  dev mode running, with an OIDC auth method fully configured.

- A [Boundary binary](/boundary/install/) greater than
  0.5.0 in your `PATH`

- This tutorial assumes that you are able to launch Boundary in [dev
  mode](/boundary/tutorials/oss-getting-started/oss-getting-started-dev).

- An [Auth0](https://auth0.com), [Okta](https://www.okta.com), or
  [Azure](https://portal.azure.com/) test account. The associated email address should
  not be tied to another SSO method, so use of a personal account is
  recommended.

- Installing [Terraform 0.13.0 or greater](/terraform/tutorials/aws-get-started/install-cli)
  provides an optional workflow for this tutorial. The binary must be available
  in your `PATH`.

## Get setup

This tutorial assumes the reader has successfully completed setting up an OIDC
provider test account according to the instructions in the
  [Auth0](/boundary/tutorials/identity-management/oidc-auth0),
  [Okta](/boundary/tutorials/identity-management/oidc-okta), or [Azure
AD](/boundary/tutorials/identity-management/oidc-azure) OIDC tutorials. The reader
should have left an instance of HCP Boundary or Boundary's dev mode running,
with the sample OIDC provider configured.

<Tip>

 If you want an environment that's easy to deploy for testing OIDC,
consider following the Terraform deployment instructions in the [OIDC
Authentication](/boundary/tutorials/identity-management/oidc-auth0) tutorial. The dev environment can
then easily be re-deployed in the future by launching Boundary and running Terraform.

</Tip>

To check that everything is set up properly, ensure that you can authenticate
via OIDC using the CLI or Admin Console.

<Tabs>
<Tab heading="Admin Console" group="admin">

The following steps demonstrate authentication to Boundary using the Auth0
provider. The steps are essentially the same for any OIDC provider. If you
encounter issues logging in, refer back to the [OIDC
Authentication](/boundary/tutorials/identity-management/oidc-auth0#authenticate-via-oidc) tutorial
for detailed steps on configuring an OIDC provider.

1. Navigate to the Boundary admin UI.

   <Tabs>
   <Tab heading="HCP Boundary" group="hcp">

   Navigate to the HCP Boundary cluster address in your browser (such as `https://a2c4e6-867-53o9-994d-b6670e90b03J.boundary.hashicorp.cloud`),
   click on "Choose a different scope" and select the **Global scope**.
   Select provider's name (such as Auth0) or "OIDC" and click **Authenticate**.

   </Tab>
   <Tab heading="Dev Mode" group="dev">

   Navigate to `http://localhost:9200` in your browser, click on "Choose a
   different scope" and select the **Generated org scope**. Select provider's
   name (such as Auth0) or "OIDC" and click **Authenticate**.

   </Tab>
   </Tabs>

   ![Auth0 Application Login](/img/boundary/oidc/oidc-admin-generated-org-scope-login.png)

2. If your browser doesn't allow pop-ups, you may be presented with an
   "Authentication Pending" message, which you can bypass by clicking **Retry**.
   If you do not encounter this message proceed to the next step. Consider
   enabling pop-ups from your localhost for the rest of this tutorial.

   ![Auth0 Application Login](/img/boundary/oidc/oidc-admin-console-1.png)

3. Next, enter your provider's test account credentials and click **Continue**.

   ![Auth0 Application Login](/img/boundary/oidc/oidc-admin-console-2.png)

4. You should receive a "Successful Authentication" message and automatically be
   redirected to the Admin Console. If you are not redirected, check to make
   sure your browser is not blocking pop-ups or allow pop-ups temporarily.

   ![Auth0 Application Login](/img/boundary/oidc/oidc-admin-console-3.png)

5. Once authenticated, navigate to the **Auth Methods** view on the left, and
   notice the `OIDC` Type and ID used when setting up the auth method. Select
   the auth method's name (such as Auth0) to view the account details. Click on
   the **Roles** tab and notice that the user associated with the account does
   not have permission to view the account details. The new user associated with
   the account has very limited permissions by default, and is unable to read the
   role details.

   ![Auth0 Application Login](/img/boundary/oidc/oidc-admin-console-4.png)

</Tab>
<Tab heading="CLI" group="cli">

Start by recursively listing the available authentication methods.

```shell-session
$ boundary auth-methods list -recursive

Auth Method information:
  ID:                     amoidc_1234567890
    Scope ID:             global
    Type:                 oidc
    Name:                 Generated global scope initial oidc auth method
    Description:          Provides initial administrative and unprivileged authentication into Boundary
    Authorized Actions:
      authenticate

  ID:                     amoidc_9zoOFfKMmJ
    Scope ID:             o_1234567890
    Type:                 oidc
    Name:                 Auth0
    Description:          OIDC auth method for Auth0
    Is Primary For Scope: true
    Authorized Actions:
      authenticate

  ID:                     ampw_1234567890
    Scope ID:             global
    Type:                 password
    Name:                 Generated global scope initial password auth method
    Description:          Provides initial administrative and unprivileged authentication into Boundary
    Is Primary For Scope: true
    Authorized Actions:
      authenticate
```

Copy the auth method oidc ID of your IdP, such as `amoidc_9zoOFfKMmJ` and
create an environment variable.

```shell-session
$ export OIDC_AUTH_ID=<actual-auth-method-id>
```

Now, log in to Boundary using the OIDC auth method.

```shell-session
$ boundary authenticate oidc -auth-method-id $OIDC_AUTH_ID
Opening returned authentication URL in your browser...

```

In your browser, enter the username and password associated with your provider's
test account.

![OIDC Login](/img/boundary/oidc/oidc-auth0-login.png)

You should receive a "Successful authentication" message. Close the browser tab
and return to your terminal.

The OIDC account is now authenticated. Notice that the new user associated with
the account has very limited permissions by default, and is unable to read the
account details for the auth method ID copied earlier.

```shell-session
$ boundary auth-methods read -id $OIDC_AUTH_ID
Error from controller when performing read on auth method

Error information:
  Kind:                PermissionDenied
  Message:             Forbidden.
  Status:              403
  context:             Error from controller when performing read on auth method
```

This tutorial will demonstrate the process of managing group IdP claims, and
assigning grants to a role that contains the managed group. All new OIDC accounts
within the group will automatically be assigned the new grants once
authenticated via Boundary.

</Tab>
</Tabs>

## Managed groups background

In Boundary, the managed group resource represents a collection of accounts. A
collection is automatically maintained by evaluating a filter defined in the
managed group's configuration against the information returned by auth method's
identity provider (IdP).

Accounts can be associated with zero or more managed groups within the same auth
method, and grants can be associated with a managed group when used as a
principle within a role.

Membership in a managed group is defined when an OIDC auth method is used for
authentication. The collection is built based on filter criteria that match
against the OIDC ID token and User Info endpoints, and every authentication
updates the group membership comparison against the filter.

### Gather OIDC account attributes

Managed Groups require filter criteria that describe which accounts belong to the
group, and in turn should inherit any scoped permissions granted by an associate
user and role. These filter attributes are returned from the OIDC provider when
a user authenticates to Boundary using an OIDC account.

Filters can be built on two types of data returned from the OIDC provider: the
claims from the [JSON Web
Token](https://openid.net/specs/draft-jones-json-web-token-07.html) (JWT), or
the claims from the
[UserInfo](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#UserInfo)
endpoint.

The claims can be obtained directly from an OIDC provider in a few ways. For
example, [claims info from Azure
AD](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/active-directory-claims-mapping)
could be obtained from the Azure Portal, the Azure CLI, The Azure AD PowerShell
Module, or by [querying endpoint
metadata](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/v2-protocols-oidc).

Boundary gathers claims info from the JWT and userinfo endpoint and stores them
as account attributes. These attributes are updated upon authentication to an
OIDC provider, and are used as the basis for resolving  a managed groups filter.

Start by displaying the gathered claims info for your IdP provider. Examples are
shown below for Auth0, Okta, and Azure AD.

### Managed groups filters

Creating a managed group requires the oidc auth method ID and a filter that
selects users for membership based on account claims.

In Boundary, [filter
expressions](/boundary/docs/concepts/filtering) are used to
extend functionality. The filter syntax includes creating expressions that match
operators with a selector and a value. These plaintext expressions support
Boolean logic and parenthesization, enabling compound expressions by connecting
logical `and`, `or` and `not` statements.

[Managed groups
filtering](/boundary/docs/concepts/filtering/oidc-managed-groups)
enables automatic group management by selecting attributes from account claims
returned by the OIDC provider. Claims associated with the JWT and userinfo
endpoints are currently available for these filters.

As an example, consider the following hypothetical attributes for a Boundary
OIDC user account.

```

</CodeBlockConfig>

Examples of filters that could be used with a managed group include:

- `"operator" in "/userinfo/roles"` matches accounts that include "operator" in the
  roles returned in the userinfo reply
- `"/token/custom/department" == "infosec"` matches accounts that have "infosec" in
  the "/token/custom/department" JWT claim
- `"boundary.com" in "/userinfo/email" and "auth0" in "/userinfo/sub"` matches
  accounts that have "boundary.com" in the email claim and auth0 in the sub claim

Expressions can be connected together to obtain the needed level of complexity
for defining group membership. In this example, a user could receive the correct
sets of permissions automatically by assigning them a role of "operator", or
using another set of claims.

<Note>

 Not all of these claims are returned from an identity provider by
default, and would require additional configuration of the provider before they
would be available to Boundary.

</Note>

In order to create a managed group, filter criteria must first be selected from a
set of account claims. Filters can be modified or updated later on after the
creation of a managed group.

## Create a managed group

<Tabs>
<Tab heading="Admin Console" group="admin">

<Tabs>
<Tab heading="Auth0" group="auth0">

Create a managed group with the following filter criteria:

`"auth0" in "/userinfo/sub"`

Log back in to the Admin Console UI global scope as the admin user.

Under the global scope, navigate to the **Auth Methods** view using the sidebar.
Select the **Auth0** Auth Method. Click the **Managed Groups** tab, and then
click **Create Managed Group**.

![New Managed Group](/img/boundary/ui-managed-groups-new.png)

Fill out the following type `oidc` managed group form fields:

- **Name**: `auth0 userinfo`
- **Filter**: `"auth0" in "/userinfo/sub"`

Click **Save**.

<Note>

 When creating a custom claim, it may be necessary to use [JSON
Pointer syntax](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6901) to render the
namespace properly. If you receive an `Error evaluating submitted filter
expression`, attempt to reformat your filter using JSON Pointer syntax. For
example, in JSON Pointer syntax `http://` is written as `http:~1~1`. If your
claim response contained `http://my-domain`, you might create the above filter
like this: `"auth0" in "/userinfo/http:~1~1my-domain/sub"`

</Note>

This filter selects all accounts whose `/userinfo/sub` claim contains `auth0`.
Any of the other filter criteria available under the `acctoidc` attributes can
be used for building an appropriate filter.

### Verify group membership

Next, verify that oidc account is correctly assigned to the managed group.

Select the **auth0 userinfo** managed group, and then the **Members** tab. The
OIDC account ID associated with the `auth0` account should be displayed
(`acctoidc_2g9lcC4fIL` in this example.)

![Managed Groups Membership](/img/boundary/ui-managed-groups-members.png)

<Note title="Troubleshooting">

 If the Member IDs section is missing, first log out of
the admin account, then log in as the OIDC user. This will refresh the userinfo
claims for the OIDC user account. Next, re-authenticate as the admin user and
attempt to verify the group membership again. If the member ID is still missing,
check that the filter defined under the account details is correct. If the
filter is incorrect, **edit** the managed group filter, then **save** the filter
and attempt to verify the group membership again.

</Note>

</Tab>
<Tab heading="Okta" group="okta">

Create a managed group with the following filter criteria:

`"okta.com" in "/token/iss"`

Log back in to the Admin Console UI global scope as the admin user.

Under the global scope, navigate to the **Auth Methods** view using the sidebar.
Select the **Okta** Auth Method. Click the **Managed Groups** tab, and then
click **Create Managed Group**.

![New Managed Group](/img/boundary/ui-managed-groups-new.png)

Fill out the following type `oidc` managed group form fields:

- **Name**: `okta userinfo`
- **Filter**: `"okta.com" in "/token/iss"`

Click **Save**.

This filter selects all accounts whose `/token/iss` claim contains `okta.com`. Any
of the other filter criteria available under the acctoidc attributes can be used
for building an appropriate filter.

### Verify group membership

Next, verify that oidc account is correctly assigned to the managed group.

Select the **okta userinfo** managed group, and then the **Members** tab. The
OIDC account ID associated with the `okta` account should be displayed
(`acctoidc_2g9lcC4fIL` in this example.)

![Managed Groups Membership](/img/boundary/ui-managed-groups-members.png)

<Note title="Troubleshooting">

 If the Member IDs section is missing, first attempt to

ID is still missing, then ensure the filter under the account details is
correct. If the filter is incorrect, **edit** the managed group filter, then
**save** the filter and attempt to verify the group membership again.

</Note>

</Tab>
<Tab heading="Azure AD" group="azure">

Create a managed group with the following filter criteria:

`"onmicrosoft.com" in "/userinfo/upn"`

Log back in to the Admin Console UI global scope as the admin user.

Under the global scope, navigate to the **Auth Methods** view using the sidebar.
Select the **Azure** Auth Method. Click the **Managed Groups** tab, and then
click **Create Managed Group**.

![New Managed Group](/img/boundary/ui-managed-groups-new.png)

Fill out the following type `oidc` managed group form fields:

- **Name**: `azure userinfo`
- **Filter**: `"onmicrosoft.com" in "/userinfo/upn"`

Click **Save**.

This filter selects all accounts whose `/userinfo/upn` claim contains
`onmicrosoft.com`. Any of the other filter criteria available under the acctoidc
attributes can be used for building an appropriate filter.

### Verify group membership

Next, verify that oidc account is correctly assigned to the managed group.

Select the **azure userinfo** managed group, and then the **Members** tab. The
OIDC account ID associated with the `azure` account should be displayed
(`acctoidc_2g9lcC4fIL` in this example.)

This tutorial expands on the Terraform configuration file created in the [OIDC
Authentication](/boundary/tutorials/identity-management/oidc-auth0) tutorial. Select the appropriate
provider, and check that your sample code matches the starting state for
defining a managed group.

<Note>

 You should already have the provider configured correctly, as
tested in the [Get setup](#get-setup) section. If you are unable to authenticate
to the provider, compare against the sample code below and refer back to the
[OIDC
Authentication](/boundary/tutorials/identity-management/oidc-auth0#activate-the-oidc-auth-method)
tutorial to run Terraform and finish setup.

</Note>

Managed groups capabilities were introduced with the 1.0.4 version of the
[Boundary provider](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/boundary).
This tutorial uses version `1.0.5`, the same version of the provider defined in
the [OIDC Authentication](/boundary/tutorials/identity-management/oidc-auth0) tutorial.

The
[boundary_managed_group](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/boundary/latest/docs/resources/managed_group)
Terraform resource is used to configure a managed group. The general structure
of the resource is:

<CodeBlockConfig hideClipboard>

```hcl
resource "boundary_managed_group" "example" {
  name           = "example"
  description    = "An example of an OIDC managed group"
  auth_method_id = boundary_auth_method_oidc.example.id
  filter         = "name == \"foo\""
}
```

</CodeBlockConfig>

The `boundary_managed_group` resource needs the ID of the
`boundary_auth_method_oidc` resource used to set up the auth method and a filter
that defines the managed group's membership. Additionally, the following schema
for the
[boundary_auth_method_oidc](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/boundary/latest/docs/resources/auth_method_oidc)
resource are useful in enabling managed groups configuration.

<CodeBlockConfig hideClipboard highlight="1,11-13,14">

```hcl
resource "boundary_auth_method_oidc" "example" {
    name           = "example"
    description    = "An example OIDC auth method using boundary's built-in OIDC test server"
    scope_id       = boundary_scope.my_org.id
    issuer         = "http://localhost:9200"
    client_id      = "foo_id"
    client_secret  = "foo_secret"
    max_age        = 10
    api_url_prefix = "http://localhost:9200"
    signing_algorithms = ["ES256"]
    allowed_audiences  = ["foo_aud"]
    account_claim_maps = ["oid=sub"]
    claims_scopes      = ["profile"]
  }
```

</CodeBlockConfig>

- The `allowed_audiences` is a list of strings for which provider responses will
  allowed
- The `account_claims_maps` is a list of strings that maps Account claims for
  the `to_claim` of `sub`
- The `claims_scopes` is a list of strings that define the claims scopes

<Tabs>
<Tab heading="Auth0" group="auth0">

Create a managed group with the following filter criteria:

`"auth0" in "/userinfo/sub"`

This filter selects all accounts whose `/userinfo/sub` claim contains `auth0`. Any
of the other filter criteria available under the acctoidc attributes can be used
for building an appropriate filter.

Add the `boundary_managed_group` resource to the `main.tf` file:

```hcl
resource "boundary_managed_group" "oidc_group" {
  name           = "Auth0"
  description    = "OIDC managed group for Auth0"
  auth_method_id = boundary_auth_method_oidc.provider.id
  filter         = "\"auth0\" in \"/userinfo/sub\""
}
```

<Note>

 Double-quoted arguments are required when defining Terraform
schema. This enables interpolation, and complicates the definition of fitlers,
which also require double-quotes. To render correctly, escape characters (`\`)
must preceed any instance of double-quotes within a filter (`"I'm an
/"example/""`). For more information, check the Terraform workflow tab in the
[Target-Aware
Workers](/boundary/tutorials/oss-configuration/target-aware-workers#define-target-worker-filters)
tutorial.

</Note>

<Note>

 When creating a custom claim, it may be necessary to use [JSON
Pointer syntax](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6901) to render the
namespace properly. If you receive an `Error evaluating submitted filter
expression`, attempt to reformat your filter using JSON Pointer syntax. For
example, in JSON Pointer syntax `http://` is written as `http:~1~1`. If your
claim response contained `http://my-domain`, you might create the above filter
like this: `\"auth0\" in \"/userinfo/http:~1~1my-domain/sub\"`.

</Note>

Additionally, add an additional `outputs` section to print the new managed group
ID.

```hcl
output "managed-group-id" {
  value = boundary_managed_group.oidc_group.id
}
```

Next, execute Terraform to apply the configuration. Enter `yes` when prompted
for confirmation.

accordion below to update the managed group filter.

</Note>

<Accordion heading="Troubleshoot Account Filters" collapse>

The managed group information will not show the account member ID for the OIDC
account if a filter is incorrectly defined.

Verify the managed group filter defined in the `boundary_managed_group`

<Note>

 You should always log back in as the OIDC user to test any newly
applied filters. Remember that managed group membership is updated when the user
authenticates to the IdP with the associated OIDC account.

</Note>

After correcting the filter, go through the steps in the [Verify group

managed-group-id = "mgoidc_ndN5Mr04a1"
```

</CodeBlockConfig>

Copy the `managed-group-id` from the command output (`mgoidc_ndN5Mr04a1` in this
example) and create an environment variable.

```shell-session
$ export MG_OIDC_ID=<actual-copied-value>
```

### Verify group membership

Next, verify that oidc account is correctly assigned to the managed group.

Authenticate again via OIDC to update the account attributes.

<CodeBlockConfig highlight="1,5">

```shell-session
$ boundary authenticate oidc -auth-method-id $OIDC_AUTH_ID

  User ID:         u_Kt2AI1hPmC

The token was successfully stored in the chosen keyring and is not displayed here.
```

</CodeBlockConfig>

Note the `Account ID`.

Now log back into Boundary as the admin user.

```shell-session
$ boundary authenticate password -auth-method-id $BOUNDARY_AUTH_METHOD_ID -login-name admin
Please enter the password (it will be hidden): <password>

Authentication information:

</CodeBlockConfig>

Notice the `Member IDs:` section, which should contain the oidc account id.

<Note title="Troubleshooting">

 If the Member IDs section is missing, ensure the filter
under the account details is correct. If the filter is incorrect, expand the
accordion below to update the managed group filter.

</Note>

<Accordion heading="Troubleshoot Account Filters" collapse>

The managed group information will not show the account member ID for the OIDC
account if a filter is incorrectly defined.

Verify the managed group filter defined in the `boundary_managed_group`
resource. If incorrect, save the updated configuration and execute `terraform
apply` again to update the filter.

<Note>

 You should always log back in as the OIDC user to test any newly
applied filters. Remember that managed group membership is updated when the user
authenticates to the IdP with the associated OIDC account.

</Note>

After correcting the filter, go through the steps in the [Verify group
membership](#verify-group-membership-3) section again to ensure the account has
been added to the managed group correctly.

## Create a role

With the managed group created and automatically managing group membership, the
next step is to apply permissions to the group by creating a role.

After creating a role, the managed group is added as a role principle and grants
are assigned to the role. To learn more about group principles, check out the
[Manage Users and Groups tutorial](/boundary/tutorials/oss-administration/oss-manage-users-groups). To
understand how permissions are granted, check out the [Manage Roles
tutorial](/boundary/tutorials/oss-administration/oss-manage-roles).

<Note>

 While basic CRUD operations can be performed on managed groups,
admins cannot currently add managed groups as role principals using the Admin
Console UI. Complete the next section using the CLI or Terraform workflows.

First, create a new role under the Generated org scope.

Open the `main.tf` file and add a new `boundary_role` resource. Add the `name`,
`description`, `principle_ids`, `grant_strings`, and `scope_id` schema.

Use the Generated org scope id, for example `o_1234567890` for the `scope_id`. For the
`principle_ids`, add the new managed group as a role principle so the group will
inherit any grants associated with the role.

Set `grant_strings` to `ids=*;type=role;actions=list,read`, which selects any
role ID and allows list and read actions to be performed. To learn more about
setting permission grants, check out the [Permission Grant Formats
documentation](/boundary/docs/concepts/security/permissions#permission-grant-formats).

Additionally, add a new `outputs` value to print the id of the role.

```hcl
resource "boundary_role" "oidc_role" {
  name          = "List and Read"
  description   = "List and read role"
  principal_ids = [boundary_managed_group.oidc_group.id]

1. Delete any test users from your OIDC provider.

   This tutorial created sample users within Auth0, Okta or Azure AD to
   authenticate via the CLI, Admin Console or Desktop app. **Revisit the
   provider settings and remove any test users created for this tutorial.**

## Next steps

This tutorial demonstrated the steps to create an OIDC managed group and assign
it grants. You set up a managed group with a filter to automatically manage
group membership, created a role, added the managed group as a role principle,
and assigned grants to the role that were inherited by the managed group's
members.

To learn more about managing user accounts, check out the [Manage Users and
Groups](/boundary/tutorials/oss-administration/oss-manage-users-groups) and [Manage
Roles](/boundary/tutorials/oss-administration/oss-manage-roles) tutorials.
