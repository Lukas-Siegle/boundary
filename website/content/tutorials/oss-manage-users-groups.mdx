Users and groups in Boundary are collectively known as **principals**. Assigning
[grants](/boundary/docs/concepts/security/permissions) on
[roles](/boundary/docs/concepts/domain-model/roles) is
performed through principal IDs; that is, the unique IDs of users, groups, or
both.

This tutorial focus on completing user management tasks within a Boundary
environment.

## Prerequisites

This tutorial assumes that you successfully completed the [Manage
Scopes](/boundary/tutorials/oss-administration/oss-manage-scopes) tutorial.

## Users

Users in Boundary represent an _internal_ notion of a particular entity (human,
machine, etc.). Users can be correlated with one or more
[account](/boundary/docs/concepts/domain-model/accounts)
resources via [auth
methods](/boundary/docs/concepts/domain-model/auth-methods).
Accounts represent _external_ notions of a particular entity. Among other
use-cases, this mechanism allows for an easy way to switch users to new IdPs
within the organization deploying Boundary.

An auth method can be defined at the org and global scopes. In this tutorial,
you will create an account and user for an auth method at the org level.

~> Currently, all auth methods create users upon authentication. If there is no
user linked with an account, Boundary creates a user when the authentication
against that account was successful. This behavior may be convenient, but in
other situations (such as when you want Terraform to describe the Boundary
resources), this may be undesirable. The steps in this tutorial demonstrate
manually making these resources and linking them. A future Boundary update will
allow turning off auto-vivification on a per-auth-method basis.

## Add an auth method

Enable a password-type auth method in the `IT_Support` org which you created in
the [Manage Scopes](/boundary/tutorials/oss-administration/oss-manage-scopes) tutorial.

<Tabs>
<Tab heading="CLI" group="cli">

Authenticate to Boundary as the `admin` user with the login name of `password`.

```shell-session
$ boundary authenticate
Please enter the login name (it will be hidden):
Please enter the password (it will be hidden):
Authentication information:
  Account ID:      acctpw_VOeNSFX8pQ
  Auth Method ID:  ampw_ZbB6UXpW3B
  Expiration Time: Mon, 13 Feb 2023 12:35:32 MST
  User ID:         u_1vUkf5fPs9
The token was successfully stored in the chosen keyring and is not displayed here.
```

Create a password auth method in the `IT_Support` org.

```shell-session
$ boundary auth-methods create password \
  -scope-id=$ORG_ID \
  -name="org_auth_method" \
  -description="Org auth method"
```

**Example:**

<CodeBlockConfig hideClipboard>

```shell-session
$ boundary auth-methods create password \
  -scope-id=$ORG_ID \
  -name="org_auth_method" \
  -description="Org auth method"

<Tab heading="Terraform" group="terraform">

In your Terraform configuration file, define a [`boundary_auth_method`
resource](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/boundary/latest/docs/resources/auth_method)
to create a new auth method under the `IT_Support` scope which you created in
the [Manage Scopes](/boundary/tutorials/oss-administration/oss-manage-scopes) tutorial.

## Create an account

Create an account for the org-scoped auth method.

<Note>

 User names must be all lowercase alphanumeric of at least 3
characters and the password must be 8 or more characters. (The minimum lengths
can be changed in the attributes for the auth method if desired.)

</Tab>
<Tab heading="Terraform" group="terraform">

This tutorial utilizes the [recovery key
workflow](/boundary/docs/oss/installing/no-gen-resources#recovery-kms-workflow)
to configure Boundary with Terraform utilizing the `recovery_kms_hcl` attribute
of the `boundary` provider:

```hcl
provider "boundary" {
  addr             = "http://127.0.0.1:9200"
  recovery_kms_hcl = <<EOT
kms "aead" {
  purpose = "recovery"
  aead_type = "aes-gcm"
  key = "Wt7KhwRKB05YlznYd5i5iPIezLHzbVFrKeZ2ewhoMwk="
  key_id = "global_recovery"
}
EOT
}
```

This is useful because it allows Boundary to be configured programmatically,
without first bootstrapping Boundary with accounts or users.

Another approach uses a pre-existing account to manage Terraform resources. This
method is not recommended, since authentication passwords should not be stored
in HCL for production environments. If using this method, consider utilizing
[Terraform input variables](/terraform/language/values/variables)
instead. Also note that the account must already exist in order for Terraform to
manage resources using this method.

<Note>

 Do NOT copy the following snippet into your `main.tf`
configuration. The following configuration is only provided as an example.

</Note>

To [configure the Boundary provider using
Terraform](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/boundary/latest/docs),
provide the valid auth method ID, login name, and password for a pre-existing
auth method to authenticate. Note that a valid `auth_method_id` must be provided
when configuring Boundary using this method, and the user must have appropriate
grants assigned to manage resources in the desired scope. The next tutorial will
discuss roles and grants.

```hcl
provider "boundary" {
  addr                            = "http://127.0.0.1:9200"
  auth_method_id                  = "ampw_sOXVI7JS2l"
  password_auth_method_login_name = "tester01"
  password_auth_method_password   = "supersecure"
}
```

Do **NOT** add this configuration to your `main.tf` file.

</Tab>
</Tabs>

## Groups

A group in Boundary is a resource that represents a collection of users that are
treated equally for the purposes of access control. A group is a principal,
which allows it to be assigned to roles. Roles assigned to a group are
indirectly assigned to the users in the group, and users receive all permissions
of the assigned roles. Groups can be defined at the
[Global](/boundary/docs/concepts/domain-model/scopes#global),
[Organization](/boundary/docs/concepts/domain-model/scopes#organizations),
or
[Project](/boundary/docs/concepts/domain-model/scopes#projects)
scope.

The group resource membership is managed manually. If using an [OIDC
Auth](/boundary/tutorials/access-management/oidc-auth) provider, such
as Auth0, Okta or Azure AD, [Managed
Groups](/boundary/docs/concepts/domain-model/managed-groups)
can be used to automatically map membership to a collection of accounts defined
by the auth method's identity provider using
[filtering](/boundary/docs/concepts/filtering/oidc-managed-groups).

## Create a group

Create a user at the org scope.

<Tabs>
<Tab heading="CLI" group="cli">

By itself, group membership does not inherently assign its members any
permissions. In the next tutorial, a
[role](/boundary/docs/concepts/domain-model/roles) will be
assigned to the group and the included members will inherit the role's
permissions.

## Next steps

This tutorial demonstrated the steps to add a new authentication method to an
org (`IT_Support`), created a new user and group within the org, and added the
user as a member of the group. You verified that you can authenticate and logged
into the `IT_Support` org using the newly created user credential.

The next step is to define the permissions to control what operations members of
the group can perform. In the [Manage Roles and
Permissions](/boundary/tutorials/oss-administration/oss-manage-roles) tutorial, you will create a role,
assign grants to the role, and then add the group as a principle of the new
role. This group members will then inherit the defined permissions.
