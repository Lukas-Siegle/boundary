Boundary must first be installed on your machine. Boundary is available as source
code, as a pre-compiled binary, or in packaged formats.

This tutorial will not cover how to compile Boundary from source, but compiling from
source is covered in the [README](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary#build-and-start-boundary-in-dev-mode) for those who
want to be sure they're compiling source they trust into the final binary.

<Tabs>
<Tab heading="macOS">

The macOS binary is available to be installed manually or through Homebrew.

<Tab heading="Manual">

To install Boundary, find the [appropriate
package](/boundary/install/) for your system and
download it. Boundary is packaged as a zip archive.

After downloading Boundary, unzip the package. Boundary runs as a single binary
named `boundary`. Make sure that the `boundary` binary is available on your
`PATH`. You can check the locations available on your path by running this
command.

```shell-session
$ echo $PATH
```

**Example output:**

```shell-session hideClipboard
/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin
```

The output is a list of locations separated by colons. You can make Boundary
available by moving the binary to one of the listed locations, or by adding
Boundary's location to your `PATH`.

<Tip>

 Permanently add a new location to your path by
editing your shell's settings file (usually called something like `~/.bashrc`,
where the part of the file name after the `.` and before `rc` is the name of
your shell). In that file you will see a line that starts with `export PATH=`,
followed by a colon-separated list of locations. Add the location of the Boundary
binary to that list and save the file. Then reload your shell's configuration
with the command `source ~/.bashrc`, replacing `bash` with the name of your
shell.

<Tab heading="Homebrew">

[Homebrew](https://brew.sh) is a free and open-source package management system
for macOS. Install the official [boundary
formula](https://github.com/hashicorp/homebrew-tap) from the terminal.

```shell-session
$ brew install hashicorp/tap/boundary
```

<Note>

 This installs a signed binary and is automatically updated with
every new official release.

</Note>

To update to the latest, run

```shell-session
$ brew upgrade hashicorp/tap/boundary
```

<Tab heading="Windows">

The Windows binary is available to be installed manually or through Scoop. 
[Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/) 
(WSL2) is recommended for Windows users running Boundary, and instructions 
can be found under the Linux tab.

download it. Boundary is packaged as a zip archive.

After downloading Boundary, unzip the package. Boundary runs as a single binary
named `boundary`. Make sure that the `boundary` binary is available on your
`PATH`. 

-> **Tip: ** Add a location to your path via the GUI by navigating to
`Environment Variables` in your system settings, and look for the variable
called `PATH`. You will see a semicolon-separated list of locations. Add the
Boundary binary's location to that list and then launch a new console window.
