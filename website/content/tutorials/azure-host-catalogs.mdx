Dynamic updates to host catalogs is an important differentiator for Boundary
from traditional access methods that rely on manual target configuration, and
enables even tighter integrations with major cloud providers for seamlessly
onboarding cloud tenant identities, roles, and targets.

Boundary 0.7 introduces a key Boundary component by enabling automated discovery
of target hosts and services. Starting with support for Azure and AWS, dynamic
connections to any service registry ensures that hosts and host catalogs are
consistently up-to-date. This critical workflow offers access-on-demand and
eliminates the need to manually configure targets for dynamic, cloud-based
infrastructure.

This tutorial demonstrates configuring a dynamic host catalog using Microsoft
Azure.

### Dynamic hosts catalog overview

1. [Get setup](#get-setup)
1. [Dynamic host catalogs background](#dynamic-host-catalogs-background)
1. [Set up cloud hosts](#set-up-cloud-hosts)
1. [Build a host catalog](#build-a-host-catalog)
1. [Verify catalog membership](#verify-catalog-membership)

## Prerequisites

- A [Boundary binary](/boundary/install/) greater than
  0.7.1 in your `PATH`.

- This tutorial assumes you can [connect to an HCP Boundary
  cluster](/boundary/tutorials/hcp-getting-started/hcp-getting-started-console) **or** launch
  Boundary in [dev mode](/boundary/tutorials/oss-getting-started/oss-getting-started-dev).

- A [Microsoft Azure](https://portal.azure.com/) account. **This tutorial
  requires the creation of new cloud resources and will incur costs associated
  with the deployment and management of these resources.**

- Installing the [Azure
  CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli) provides an
  optional workflow for this tutorial.The executable must be available within
  your `PATH`.

- Installing [Terraform 0.14.9 or greater](/terraform/tutorials/aws-get-started/install-cli)
  provides an optional workflow for this tutorial. The binary must be available
  in your `PATH`.

## Get setup

In this tutorial, you will test dynamic host catalog integrations using HCP
Boundary or by running a Boundary controller locally using dev mode.

<Tabs>
<Tab heading="HCP" group="hcp">

The [HCP Quickstart](/boundary/tutorials/hcp-getting-started) tutorials
provide an overview of getting started with an HCP Boundary cluster.

If you have an HCP Boundary cluster deployed, the [Access HCP
Boundary](/boundary/tutorials/hcp-getting-started/hcp-getting-started-console) tutorial provides an
overview of configuring your local machine to authenticate with your HCP
cluster.

This tutorial provides both CLI and UI workflows for setting up OIDC
authentication.

<Tabs>
<Tab heading="CLI" group="cli">

To proceed with the CLI workflow:

1. Log in to the Boundary web UI and copy your org ID by clicking the copy icon.

   Open a terminal session and **set a environment variable for the org ID.**

   ```shell-session
   $ export ORG_ID=<org-id>
   ```

1. In the Boundary web UI, click **Projects** and copy your project ID by clicking the copy icon.

   Open a terminal session and **set a environment variable for the project ID.**

   ```shell-session
   $ export PROJECT_ID=<project-id>
   ```

1. In the Boundary web UI, click **Orgs** in the left navigation menu to return
   to the global scope, and then click **Auth Methods**.

   Click the copy icon for the **Password** auth method.

   In your terminal **set an environment variable named `BOUNDARY_AUTH_METHOD_ID`** to the
   copied ID.

   ```shell-session
   $ export BOUNDARY_AUTH_METHOD_ID=<auth-id>
   ```

   Close the Boundary web UI.

1. Return to the HCP web Portal **Boundary** page, then click the copy icon for
   the **Cluster URL** in the **Getting started with Boundary** section.

   In your terminal, **set the `BOUNDARY_ADDR` environment variable** to the
   copied URL.

   ```shell-session
   $ export BOUNDARY_ADDR=<actual-boundary-address>
   ```

1. Log in with the administrator credentials you created when you deployed the
   HCP Boundary instance. Enter your password at the `Please enter the password
   (it will be hidden):` prompt.

   ```shell-session
   $ boundary authenticate
   Please enter the login name (it will be hidden):
   Please enter the password (it will be hidden):
   Authentication information:
     Account ID:      acctpw_VOeNSFX8pQ

     User ID:         u_1vUkf5fPs9
   The token was successfully stored in the chosen keyring and is not displayed here.
   ```

You are now logged into your HCP Boundary instance's **Global** scope via the
CLI. This is the default scope for all new Boundary clusters.

</Tab>
<Tab heading="Admin Console" group="admin">

To proceed with the UI workflow:

1. Open the Admin Console UI by entering your HCP Boundary Cluster URL into a
   browser (such as
   `https://e58fe114-7624-431c-994d-b6670e90b03J.boundary.hashicorp.cloud`).

1. Enter the admin username and password you created when you deployed the new
   instance and click **Authenticate**.

![Admin UI Login](/img/boundary/boundary-ui-login-hcp_light.png#light-theme-only)
![Admin UI Login](/img/boundary/boundary-ui-login-hcp_dark.png#dark-theme-only)

You are now logged into your HCP Boundary instance's **Global** scope via the
web UI. This is the default scope for all new Boundary clusters. You can now
proceed to the [Providers](#providers) section to proceed with the Admin Console
UI workflow.

</Tab>
<Tab heading="Terraform" group="terraform">

To proceed with the Terraform workflow:

The following values are needed to set up the [Boundary Terraform
provider](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/boundary). The
`password_auth_method_login_name` and `password_auth_method_password` are
created when first [setting up HCP
Boundary](/boundary/tutorials/hcp-getting-started/hcp-getting-started-create), and the others can be
gathered from the HCP portal or the Boundary Admin Console UI.

- `addr` (from HCP portal)
- `auth_method_id` (from Boundary Admin Console UI)
- `password_auth_method_login_name` (from initial Boundary Cluster creation)
- `password_auth_method_password` (from initial Boundary Cluster creation)
- `scope_id` (global scope from Boundary Admin Console UI)

Locate these values and have them ready for setting up the Terraform config
files later on.

## Dynamic host catalogs background

In a cloud operating model infrastructure resources are highly dynamic and
ephemeral. Boundary lacks an on-target agent or daemon, and as a result cannot
recognize when a host service migrates or is redeployed. Instead, Boundary
relies on an external entity, such as manual configuration by an administrator
or IaC application (such as Terraform), to ensure host definitions route to the
appropriate network location. This is a pattern followed by many other secure
access solutions.

Dynamic host catalog plugins provide an alternative mechanism for automating the
discovery and configuration of Boundary hosts and targets by delegating the host
registry and their connection information to a cloud infrastructure provider.
Administrators provide credentials to the catalog provider and a set of
tag-based rules for discovery resources in the catalog. For example, "this
catalog contains all VMs in Azure's useast region within the marketing
subscription". This model differs from other that rely on either IaC target
discovery or agent-based target discovery.

To accommodate this model, Boundary 0.7.0 introduces plugin support via
[Go-Plugin](https://github.com/hashicorp/go-plugin) for expanding the dynamic
host catalog ecosystem. While this initial release of Boundary plug-ins are
limited to dynamic host catalogs, plugins enable a future ecosystem of partner
and community contributed integrations across each step in the Boundary access
workflow.

### Host tag filtering

To successfully maintain a dynamic host catalog, hosts should be tagged in a
logical way that enables sorting into the appropriate host sets identifiable by
filters.

For examples, this tutorial configures hosts on Azure using the following tags:

- `"tagName eq 'service-type' and tagValue eq 'database'"`
- `"tagName eq 'application' and tagValue eq 'dev'"`
- `"tagName eq 'application' and tagValue eq 'production'"`

Hosts with these tags will be sorted into any host catalogs and host sets
configured using these filtering attributes.

## Set up cloud hosts

<Warning>

 This tutorial deploys cloud machines to test host catalog plugin
configuration. You are responsible for any costs incurred by following the steps
in this tutorial. Recommendations for destroying the  associated cloud resources
are detailed in the [Cleanup and teardown](#cleanup-and-teardown) section.

</Warning>

A Microsoft Azure account and sample application are required to setup the
Boundary [Azure host plugin](https://github.com/hashicorp/boundary-plugin-host-azure).
If you don't have an account, [sign up for Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/).
A free account is suitable for the steps outlined in this tutorial, but please note that
you are responsible for any charges incurred by following the steps in this tutorial.

This tutorial enables configuration of the test hosts using the Azure CLI,
Terraform, or the Azure Portal UI.

<Tabs>
<Tab heading="CLI" group="cli">

There are four tasks necessary to set up hosts using the Azure CLI.

1. Create an Application in Azure Active Directory with an associated Service
Principal
1. Create a role assignment granting the new application Reader permissions to
your subscription
1. Generate a Client Secret for the Azure Active Directory Application,
enabling Boundary to authenticate
1. Tag the hosts, so they can be filtered into catalogs by Boundary.

### Register a new Azure AD application

First, log in to Azure. You will need to know the [Tenant domain
name](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/partner-center/find-ids-and-domain-names).
If you need to add a new Tenant to your Subscription, [create a new
Tenant](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/partner-center/multi-tenant-account)
and then copy its domain.

```shell-session
$ az login --tenant boundary.onmicrosoft.com
The default web browser has been opened at https://login.microsoftonline.com/0e3e2e88-8caf-41ca-b4da-q3b33b6c43tz/oauth2/v2.0/authorize. Please continue the login in the web browser. If no web browser is available or if the web browser fails to open, use device code flow with `az login --use-device-code`.
```

A browser window will open prompting you to login with your Azure credentials.
Upon successful authentication, you should receive a  confirmation message that
`You have logged into Microsoft Azure!`, and you can then close the browser tab.

Returning to the terminal session, you should see updated output containing the
`tenantID`.

**Example output:**

<CodeBlockConfig hideClipboard highlight="1,7,12">

```shell-session
$ az login --tenant boundaryoidc.onmicrosoft.com
The default web browser has been opened at https://login.microsoftonline.com/0e3e2e88-8caf-41ca-b4da-q3b33b6c43tz/oauth2/v2.0/authorize. Please continue the login in the web browser. If no web browser is available or if the web browser fails to open, use device code flow with `az login --use-device-code`.
[
  {
    "cloudName": "AzureCloud",
    "homeTenantId": "0e3e2e88-8caf-41ca-b4da-q3b33b6c43tz",
    "id": "c9ed8610-47a3-4107-a2b2-a322114dkd78",
    "isDefault": true,
    "managedByTenants": [],
    "name": "Default Subscription",
    "state": "Enabled",
    "tenantId": "0e3e2e88-8caf-41ca-b4da-q3b33b6c43tz",
    "user": {
      "name": "admin@boundary.com",
      "type": "user"
    }
  }
]
```

</CodeBlockConfig>

Copy the Tenant ID (`0e3e2e88-8caf-41ca-b4da-q3b33b6c43tz` in this example).

Additionally, copy the `id` field, which contains the Subscription ID
(`c9ed8610-47a3-4107-a2b2-a322114dkd78` in this example). These values will be
used in the next step and when configuring Boundary.

<Note>

 Subscription and Tenant IDs can also be gathered using the `az
account list` command.

</Note>

Export the Tenant ID and Subscription ID as environment variables for use in the
following steps.

```shell-session
$ export ARM_TENANT_ID=<Tenant ID> \
  export ARM_SUBSCRIPTION_ID=<Subscription ID>
```

The Azure AD application needs a service principle that enables role-based
access control (RBAC) to other resources, in this case the ability to read
subscription information. This will allow Boundary to filter for hosts that
match its filter criteria later on. This type of application is created using
the `az ad sp create-for-rbac` command.

<CodeBlockConfig highlight="1,6">

```shell-session
$ az ad sp create-for-rbac --name "Boundary Dynamic Hosts Test" --role Reader
Creating 'Reader' role assignment under scope '/subscriptions/c9ed8610-47a3-4107-a2b2-a322114dkd78'
The output includes credentials that you must protect. Be sure that you do not include these credentials in your code or check the credentials into your source control. For more information, see https://aka.ms/azadsp-cli
'name' property in the output is deprecated and will be removed in the future. Use 'appId' instead.
{
  "appId": "c2f9b423-9aa1-4ed4-809d-0af5b28397f9",
  "displayName": "Boundary Dynamic Hosts Test",
  "name": "c2f9b423-9aa1-4ed4-809d-0af5b28397f9",
  "password": "fdrAfz72~FSw8ZHZG1y2Nd83iBG~k-Y_Io",
  "tenant": "0e3e2e88-8caf-41ca-b4da-q3b33b6c43tz"
}
```

</CodeBlockConfig>

Copy the `appId` from the output (`c2f9b423-9aa1-4ed4-809d-0af5b28397f9` in this
example). This is the Application or Client ID. Export it as an environment
variable.

```shell-session
$ export ARM_CLIENT_ID=<Client ID>
```

Now, create a role assignment for the new application granting it the Reader
role within your subscription. Supply the `appID` and Subscription ID using the
environment variables exported earlier.

```shell-session
$ az role assignment create \
  --assignee $ARM_CLIENT_ID \
  --role Reader \
  --scope /subscriptions/$ARM_SUBSCRIPTION_ID
```

**Example output:**

<CodeBlockConfig hideClipboard>

```shell-session
$ az role assignment create \
  --assignee $ARM_CLIENT_ID \
  --role Reader \
  --scope /subscriptions/$ARM_SUBSCRIPTION_ID
{
  "canDelegate": null,
  "condition": null,

  "roleDefinitionName": "Reader",
  "scope": "/subscriptions/0e3e2e88-8caf-41ca-b4da-q3b33b6c43tz",
  "type": "Microsoft.Authorization/roleAssignments"
}
```

</CodeBlockConfig>

### Generate a client secret for the application

With the application created and Reader role assigned, generate an application
client secret for Boundary to use for authentication.

The `az add app credential reset` command is used to append or overwrite an
application's password or certificate credentials.

```shell-session
$ az ad app credential reset --append \
  --id $ARM_CLIENT_ID \
  --credential-description "boundary-secret"
```

**Example output:**

<CodeBlockConfig hideClipboard highlight="1-3,8">

```shell-session
$ az ad app credential reset --append \
  --id $ARM_CLIENT_ID \
  --credential-description "boundary-secret"
The output includes credentials that you must protect. Be sure that you do not include these credentials in your code or check the credentials into your source control. For more information, see https://aka.ms/azadsp-cli
{
  "appId": "c2f9b423-9aa1-4ed4-809d-0af5b28397f9",
  "name": "c2f9b423-9aa1-4ed4-809d-0af5b28397f9",
  "password": "FJY4nDv7P_bKgQBrY-k2MWwrfm-mj130Bq",
  "tenant": "0e3e2e88-8caf-41ca-b4da-q3b33b6c43tz"
}
```

</CodeBlockConfig>

Export the `password` returned in the output
(`FJY4nDv7P_bKgQBrY-k2MWwrfm-mj130Bq` in this example) as an environment
variable for use when configuring Boundary later on. **Store this value
somewhere safe, because it cannot be accessed again.**

```shell-session
$ export ARM_CLIENT_SECRET=FJY4nDv7P_bKgQBrY-k2MWwrfm-mj130Bq
```

### Create hosts

With the Azure AD application in place, hosts can be deployed to test the
dynamic host catalog integration.

To easily deploy a set of pre-configured hosts, a template file is available for
use with the Azure Resource Manager (ARM).

Clone down the sample template repository.

```shell-session
$ git clone https://github.com/hashicorp-education/learn-boundary-cloud-host-catalogs.git
```

Navigate into the `azure` directory.

```shell-session
$ cd learn-boundary-cloud-host-catalogs/azure/
```

Next, deploy a new resource group using the provided `azure-dynamic-hosts`
template.

First, create a new resource group within your subscription that will contain
the hosts. This tutorial uses the `eastus` location, but you can use any
location you want. Check the available locations with `az account
list-locations`.

```shell-session
$ az group create \
  --location eastus \
  --name boundary-dynamic-hosts_group \
  --subscription $ARM_SUBSCRIPTION_ID
```

**Example output:**

<CodeBlockConfig hideClipboard>

```shell-session
$ az group create \
  --location eastus \
  --name boundary-dynamic-hosts_group \
  --subscription $ARM_SUBSCRIPTION_ID
{
  "id": "/subscriptions/0e3e2e88-8caf-41ca-b4da-q3b33b6c43tz/resourceGroups/boundary-dynamic-hosts_group",
  "location": "eastus",
  "managedBy": null,
  "name": "boundary-dynamic-hosts_group",
  "properties": {
    "provisioningState": "Succeeded"
  },
  "tags": null,
  "type": "Microsoft.Resources/resourceGroups"
}
```

</CodeBlockConfig>

With the new resource group created, the host template file can be deployed.

```shell-session
$ az deployment group create \
  --resource-group boundary-dynamic-hosts_group \
  --template-file azure-dynamic-hosts.template
```

The output will prompt `Please provide securestring value for 'adminPasswordOrKey'
(? for help):`

This is a required password or SSH key to access the VMs.

<Note>

 This tutorial does not log into the associated VMs, but it is best
practice to copy the password or retain the private key for the duration of the
tutorial.

</Note>

After entering a password, hit `Enter` to proceed.

The deployment will take a few minutes. When complete, a large amount of output
will be displayed containing details for the newly created hosts and associated
resources.

Check the template deployment completed successfully by querying the deployment
group. List all resources in the `boundary-dynamic-hosts_group` using the
`--query` option on the `az` command.

```shell-session
$ az deployment group list --resource-group boundary-dynamic-hosts_group --query "[].properties.dependencies[*].resourceName[]"
[
  "boundary-vm-test_group-vnet/boundary-subnet",
  "boundary-vm-3-production",
  "boundary-vm-4-production",
  "boundary-vm-NetInt-1",
  "boundary-vm-NetInt-2",
  "boundary-vm-NetInt-3",
  "boundary-vm-NetInt-4",
  "boundary-vm1-dev",
  "boundary-vm2-dev"
]
```

### Gather plugin details

To use the Boundary Azure hosts plugin, the following details must be gathered
from Azure:

- ARM Tenant (Directory) ID
- ARM Subscription ID
- ARM Client (Application) ID
- ARM Client Secret

These values should be available as environment variables within the terminal
session, or copied to a safe location for use when setting up Boundary.

</Tab>
<Tab heading="Terraform" group="terraform">


The prerequisites for setting up the learning environment with Terraform are:

1. [Terraform 0.14.9 or greater](/terraform/tutorials/aws-get-started/install-cli) or greater is installed
1. An Azure account with an active subscription
1. The Azure CLI is installed and available in your `PATH`.


There are three tasks within Azure that Terraform needs to configure to set up
the lab environment.

1. Create an Application in Azure Active Directory with an associated Service
   Principal
1. Create a role assignment granting the new application Reader permissions to
your subscription
1. Generate a Client Secret for the Azure Active Directory Application,
enabling Boundary to authenticate

### Register a new Azure AD application

First, log in to Azure. You will need to know the [Tenant domain
name](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/partner-center/find-ids-and-domain-names).
If you need to add a new Tenant to your Subscription, [create a new
Tenant](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/partner-center/multi-tenant-account)
and then copy its domain.

```shell-session
$ az login --tenant boundary.onmicrosoft.com
The default web browser has been opened at https://login.microsoftonline.com/0e3e2e88-8caf-41ca-b4da-q3b33b6c43tz/oauth2/v2.0/authorize. Please continue the login in the web browser. If no web browser is available or if the web browser fails to open, use device code flow with `az login --use-device-code`.
```

A browser window will open prompting you to login with your Azure credentials.
Upon successful authentication, you should receive a  confirmation message that
`You have logged into Microsoft Azure!`, and you can then close the browser tab.

Returning to the terminal session, you should see updated output containing the
`tenantID`.

**Example output:**

<CodeBlockConfig hideClipboard highlight="1,7,12">

```shell-session
$ az login --tenant boundaryoidc.onmicrosoft.com
The default web browser has been opened at https://login.microsoftonline.com/0e3e2e88-8caf-41ca-b4da-q3b33b6c43tz/oauth2/v2.0/authorize. Please continue the login in the web browser. If no web browser is available or if the web browser fails to open, use device code flow with `az login --use-device-code`.
[
  {
    "cloudName": "AzureCloud",
    "homeTenantId": "0e3e2e88-8caf-41ca-b4da-q3b33b6c43tz",
    "id": "c9ed8610-47a3-4107-a2b2-a322114dkd78",
    "isDefault": true,
    "managedByTenants": [],
    "name": "Default Subscription",
    "state": "Enabled",
    "tenantId": "0e3e2e88-8caf-41ca-b4da-q3b33b6c43tz",
    "user": {
      "name": "admin@boundary.com",
      "type": "user"
    }
  }
]
```

</CodeBlockConfig>

Copy the Tenant ID (`0e3e2e88-8caf-41ca-b4da-q3b33b6c43tz` in this example).

Additionally, copy the `id` field, which contains the Subscription ID
(`c9ed8610-47a3-4107-a2b2-a322114dkd78` in this example). These values will be
used in the next step and when configuring Boundary.

<Note>

 Subscription and Tenant IDs can also be gathered using the `az
account list` command.

</Note>

Export the Tenant ID and Subscription ID as environment variables for use in the
following steps.

```shell-session
$ export ARM_TENANT_ID=<Tenant ID> \
  export ARM_SUBSCRIPTION_ID=<Subscription ID>
```

Create a new working directory called `learn-dynamic-host-catalogs` and change
into that directory. This tutorial assumes working out of the home directory
`~/`.

```shell-session
$ mkdir learn-dynamic-host-catalogs && cd learn-dynamic-host-catalogs/
```

Create a new file called `main.tf` and paste the following configuration.

```hcl
# Configure the Azure provider
terraform {
  required_providers {
    azurerm = {
      source  = "hashicorp/azurerm"
      version = "~> 2.65"
    }
    azuread = {
      source  = "hashicorp/azuread"
      version = "~> 2.11.0"
    }
  }

  required_version = ">= 0.14.9"
}

output "client_id" {
  value = azuread_application.boundary_app.application_id
}

provider "azurerm" {
  features {}
}

provider "azuread" {
}

resource "azurerm_resource_group" "boundary_rg" {
  name     = "boundary-dynamic-hosts_group"
  location = "eastus"
}

# Create an application with Reader app role
data "azurerm_subscription" "primary" {}
data "azuread_client_config" "current" {}

resource "azuread_application" "boundary_app" {
  display_name = "boundary_app"
  owners       = [data.azuread_client_config.current.object_id]

  app_role {
    allowed_member_types = ["Application"]
    description          = "Reader role enabling app to read subscription details"
    display_name         = "Reader"
    enabled              = true
    id                   = "1b19509b-32b1-4e9f-b71d-4992aa991967"
    value                = "Read.All"
  }
}

# Create a service principle for the application
resource "azuread_service_principal" "boundary_service_principal" {
  application_id = azuread_application.boundary_app.application_id
  app_role_assignment_required = false
  owners         = [data.azuread_client_config.current.object_id]
}

# Assign the Contributor role to the application service principle
resource "azurerm_role_assignment" "contributor_role_assignment" {
  scope                = data.azurerm_subscription.primary.id
  role_definition_name = "Contributor"
  principal_id         = azuread_service_principal.boundary_service_principal.object_id
}
```

<Note>

 The `location` of your resource group is hardcoded in this example.
If you do not have access to the resource group location `eastus`, update the
`main.tf` file with your [Azure
region](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/regions).

</Note>

<Note>

 The `id` of the `app_role` is arbitrary and hardcoded in this
example. You may use the provided `id`, or replace it with your own.

</Note>

Now initialize the Terraform plan.

```shell-session
$ terraform init

Initializing the backend...

Initializing provider plugins...
- Finding hashicorp/azurerm versions matching "~> 2.65"...
- Finding hashicorp/azuread versions matching "~> 2.11.0"...

Terraform has created a lock file .terraform.lock.hcl to record the provider
selections it made above. Include this file in your version control repository
so that Terraform can guarantee to make the same selections by default when
you run "terraform init" in the future.

Terraform has been successfully initialized!

You may now begin working with Terraform. Try running "terraform plan" to see
any changes that are required for your infrastructure. All Terraform commands
should now work.

If you ever set or change modules or backend configuration for Terraform,
rerun this command to reinitialize your working directory. If you forget, other
commands will detect it and remind you to do so if necessary.
```

After initialization, apply the plan and confirm by inputting `yes` when
prompted.

### Create hosts

With the Azure AD application in place, hosts can be deployed to test the
dynamic host catalog integration.

Create a new Terraform configuration file called `hosts.tf`. Paste the following
configuration in the new hosts file.

```hcl
# Configure the Azure VM hosts
variable "instances" {
  default = [
    "boundary-vm-1",
    "boundary-vm-2",
    "boundary-vm-3",
    "boundary-vm-4"
  ]
}

variable "vm_tags" {
  default = [
    {"service-type":"database", "application":"dev"},
    {"service-type":"database", "application":"dev"},
    {"service-type":"database", "application":"production"},

  size                = "Standard_B1ls"
  admin_username      = "adminuser"
  admin_password      = "SuperSecret123"
  disable_password_authentication = false
  network_interface_ids = [element(azurerm_network_interface.nic.*.id, count.index)]
  tags = var.vm_tags[count.index]

  os_disk {
    caching              = "ReadWrite"
    storage_account_type = "Standard_LRS"
  }

    offer     = "CentOS"
    sku       = "7_9-gen2"
    version   = "latest"
  }
}
```

Save this file and run `terraform apply` again, confirming the new configuration
by entering `yes` when prompted.

 For comparison, you can find the `main.tf` and `hosts.tf` files
within the `azure/terraform/` directory in the

### Generate a client secret for the application

With the Azure AD application and hosts created, generate an application client
secret for Boundary to use for authentication.

The `az add app credential reset` command is used to append or overwrite an
application's password or certificate credentials.

```shell-session
$ az ad app credential reset --append \
  --id $ARM_CLIENT_ID \
  --credential-description "boundary-secret"
```

**Example output:**

<CodeBlockConfig hideClipboard highlight="1-3,8">

```shell-session
$ az ad app credential reset --append \
  --id $ARM_CLIENT_ID \
  --credential-description "boundary-secret"
The output includes credentials that you must protect. Be sure that you do not include these credentials in your code or check the credentials into your source control. For more information, see https://aka.ms/azadsp-cli
{
  "appId": "72a29e03-c0fc-42b4-bf58-83792425e497",
  "name": "e04478dd-66e1-4d4b-ab48-d45c34a31a96",
  "password": "K_6DkmSPRn3~ddhJR7G-VQCeL743wYP0nr",
  "tenant": "0e3e2e88-8caf-41ca-b4da-q3b33b6c43tz"
}
```

</CodeBlockConfig>

Export the `password` returned in the output
(`K_6DkmSPRn3~ddhJR7G-VQCeL743wYP0nr` in this example) as an environment
variable for use when configuring Boundary later on. **Store this value
somewhere safe, because it cannot be accessed again.**

```shell-session
$ export ARM_CLIENT_SECRET=<password>
```

### Gather plugin details

To use the Boundary Azure hosts plugin, the following details must be gathered
from Azure:

- ARM Tenant (Directory) ID
- ARM Subscription ID
- ARM Client (Application) ID
- ARM Client Secret

These values should be available as environment variables within the terminal
session, or copied to a safe location for use when setting up Boundary.

Check that the values have been exported in your current shell session:

```shell-session
$ echo $ARM_TENANT_ID; echo $ARM_SUBSCRIPTION_ID; echo $ARM_CLIENT_ID; echo $ARM_CLIENT_SECRET
0e3e2e88-8caf-41ca-b4da-q3b33b6c43tz
c9ed8610-47a3-4107-a2b2-a322114dkd78
c2520eac-f580-435a-a12a-1efc823ca054
K_6DkmSPRn3~ddhJR7G-VQCeL743wYP0nr
```

</Tab>
<Tab heading="Azure Portal" group="azure-portal">

There are four tasks necessary to set up hosts using the Azure Portal:

1. Create an Application in Azure Active Directory, which creates an associated
Service Principal
1. Generate a Client Secret for the Azure Active Directory
Application, enabling Boundary to authenticate
1. Grant the Service Principal access to read resources in your Azure
subscription
1. Tag the hosts, so they can be filtered into catalogs by Boundary.

### Register a new Azure AD application

Navigate to the **Azure Active Directory** overview within the Azure Portal and
select the **App Registration** blade.

![Azure Portal](/img/boundary/boundary-oidc-azure-create-user-0.png)

Click the **New registration** button at the top to create a new application
within Azure Active Directory.

![Azure Create Application](/img/boundary/boundary-oidc-azure-create-app-0.png)

On this page, set the following values:

- `Name`: This tutorial calls the application `Boundary Dynamic Hosts Test`
- `Supported Account Types`: Set this to `Accounts in this organizational
  directory only (single-tenant)`
- `Redirect URI`: Choose "Web" for the URI type.

Select **Register**.

![Azure Create Application](/img/boundary/azure/azure-app-dynamic-hosts-create.png)

The newly created Azure Active Directory application should now be visible
on-screen. If not, navigate to the the **App Registration** blade and select the
Azure Active Directory application (`Boundary Dynamic Hosts Test`).

At the top of application overview page, copy these values for later use:

- `Application (client) ID`
- `Directory (tenant) ID`

![Azure Create Application](/img/boundary/azure/azure-app-dynamic-hosts-details.png)

### Generate a client secret for the application

Next, create a Client Secret for Boundary to use for authentication.

Select `Certificates & Secrets`. This screen displays the Certificates and
Client Secrets (i.e. passwords) which are associated with this Azure Active
Directory Application.

![Azure Create Secret](/img/boundary/azure/azure-app-dynamic-hosts-new-secret.png)

Click **New client secret** and fill out the secret details. This tutorial
describes the secret as *Boundary Dynamic Hosts Test Secret*.

Click **Add**.

![Azure New Secret](/img/boundary/azure/azure-app-dynamic-hosts-secret-details.png)

Copy the client **Secret** value and store it for use later. Ensure you grab the
**Value**, _not_ the Secret ID.

![Azure New Secret](/img/boundary/azure/azure-app-dynamic-hosts-copy-secret.png)

### Grant the application access to manage resources in your Azure Subscription

In order for Boundary to read host details, the new application must be granted
permissions to read resources in the Azure Subscription.

Use the *Search resources* box at the top of the Azure Portal to search for **Subscriptions**.

![Azure Subscriptions](/img/boundary/azure/azure-app-dynamic-hosts-locate-subscriptions.png)

From the **Subscriptions** blade, select the name of the subscription you would
like to use.

![Azure Subscriptions](/img/boundary/azure/azure-app-dynamic-hosts-all-subscriptions.png)

~> If no subscription exists, first ensure you are located in the correct
Directory, and [switch
directories](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/updates/edit-directory-now-in-new-portal/)
if necessary. If you created the application in the wrong directory, you may
need to re-create the application to proceed. If no subscriptions exist in any
directory, you will need to follow the instructions for [setting up a new
subscription](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cost-management-billing/manage/create-subscription).
A free subscription trial should be sufficient for completing this tutorial, but
note that you are responsible for any incurred charges.

On this page, copy the **Subscription ID** for the subscription you would like
to use.

![Azure Subscriptions](/img/boundary/azure/azure-app-dynamic-hosts-copy-subscription.png)

Next, click **Access Control (IAM)** and select **Add role assignment** under
*Grant access to this resource*.

![Azure Role Assignment](/img/boundary/azure/azure-app-dynamic-hosts-add-role-assignment.png)

Use the *Search by role name or description* box to search for the **Reader**
role, with a Description of *View all resources, but does not allow you to make
any changes*.

Select **Reader**, then click **Next**.

![Azure Reader Role](/img/boundary/azure/azure-app-dynamic-hosts-select-reader-role.png)

Under the **Members** page, click the **+ Select Members** button.

Use the *Search by name or email address* box to search for the **Boundary
Dynamic Hosts Test** application name you created earlier, and select it.

![Azure Reader Role](/img/boundary/azure/azure-app-dynamic-hosts-assign-reader-role.png)

With the application listed under *Selected members:*, click **Select**.

Lastly, click the **Review + assign** button, and then click **Review + assign**
again if the role assignment details appear correct.

### Create hosts

With the application configured, test hosts can be set up. These hosts will be
members of Boundary's dynamic host catalog.

Navigate **Home** and open the hamburger menu on the upper-left of the Azure
portal. Select **+ Create a resource**.

![Azure Create a resource](/img/boundary/azure/azure-app-dynamic-hosts-create-a-resource.png)

Using the search box, type **template** and select **Template deployment** from
the list of results.

![Azure Resource Template](/img/boundary/azure/azure-app-dynamic-hosts-select-template.png)

From the *Template deployment (deploy using custom templates)* page, select
**Create**.

![Azure Resource Template](/img/boundary/azure/azure-app-dynamic-hosts-template-deployment.png)

Under the *Custom deployment* page, select **Build your own template in the
editor**.

![Azure Resource Template](/img/boundary/azure/azure-app-dynamic-hosts-build-your-own-template.png)

Under the *Edit template* page, delete the custom template scaffolding.

![Azure Resource Template](/img/boundary/azure/azure-app-dynamic-hosts-delete-template.png)

The custom template contents can be found in the
[learn-boundary-cloud-host-catalogs Github
repository](https://github.com/hashicorp-education/learn-boundary-cloud-host-catalogs).
**Open this repository in a new browser tab and navigate to the
`azure/azure-dynamic-hosts.template` file.**

This template creates **4** separate Virtual Machines for testing with a
Boundary host catalog. The resources needed to deploy these VMs are specified
within the template file.

**Copy the contents of the `azure-dynamic-hosts.template` file.**

Navigate back to the Azure Portal, and paste the template contents into the
*Edit template* form.

![Azure Resource Template](/img/boundary/azure/azure-app-dynamic-hosts-populate-template.png)

Click **Save**.

The *Custom deployment* page is populated with the parameters available from the
template. Under the **Resource group** field, select **Create new**. Enter
`boundary-dynamic-hosts_group` as the *Name* and click **OK**.

Next, a password or private key must be configured.

<Note>

 This tutorial does not log into the associated VMs, but it is best
practice to copy the password or retain the private key for the duration of the
tutorial.

</Note>

After entering a password or configuring a private key, click **Review +
create**.

![Azure Resource Template](/img/boundary/azure/azure-app-dynamic-hosts-deployment-details.png)

When the template parameters are validated a *Validation Passed* message will be
displayed.

<Note>

 If the template validation fails, you may have copy-and-pasted the
contents of the template incorrectly. Navigate back to the **Basics** tab,
select **Edit template** and re-populate the template contents with the content
of the `azure-dynamic-hosts.template` file.

</Note>

![Azure Resource Template](/img/boundary/azure/azure-app-dynamic-hosts-template-validation.png)

Click **Create**.

After some time, a notification that **Your deployment is complete** will be
displayed.

![Azure Resource Template](/img/boundary/azure/azure-app-dynamic-hosts-deployment-complete.png)

Select **Go to resource group** and keep this page open for reference later.

### Gather plugin details

To use the Boundary Azure hosts plugin, the following details must be gathered
from Azure:

- ARM Tenant (Directory) ID
- ARM Subscription ID
- ARM Client (Application) ID
- ARM Client Secret

Ensure these values have been copied from the Azure Portal. If not, proceed back
to the **Azure AD** and **Subscriptions** Blades and copy their values.

Now define the ARM parameters gathered when creating the cloud hosts as
environment variables to use when setting up Boundary.

```shell-session
$ export ARM_TENANT_ID=<Tenant ID> \
  export ARM_SUBSCRIPTION_ID=<Subscription ID> \
  export ARM_CLIENT_ID=<Client ID> \
  export ARM_CLIENT_SECRET=<Client secret>
```

Check that the values have been exported in your current shell session:

```shell-session
$ echo $ARM_TENANT_ID; echo $ARM_SUBSCRIPTION_ID; echo $ARM_CLIENT_ID; echo $ARM_CLIENT_SECRET
0e3e2e88-8caf-41ca-b4da-q3b33b6c43tz
c9ed8610-47a3-4107-a2b2-a322114dkd78
c2f9b423-9aa1-4ed4-809d-0af5b28397f9
K_6DkmSPRn3~ddhJR7G-VQCeL743wYP0nr
```

</Tab>
</Tabs>


## Host catalog plugins

For Boundary, the process for creating a dynamic host catalog has two steps:

1. Create a plugin-type host catalog
1. Create a host set that defines membership using filters

A plugin-type host catalog can be created using some cloud provider resource
details, and the host set is then defined using a filter that selects hosts for
membership based on the tags defined when [setting up the hosts](#set-up-cloud-hosts).

Host set filter expressions are defined by the plugin provider, in this case
Azure. The Azure plugin uses simple filter queries to specify tags associated
with hosts based on `tagName` and `tagValue`.

For example, a host set filter that selects all hosts tagged with
`"service_type": "database"` is written as:

- `"tagName eq 'service-type' and tagValue eq 'database'"`

Resources within Azure can generally be filtered by tag names and values, and
additional operators such as `ne` (not equals) can be utilized.

To learn more about Azure filters for listing resources, visit the `$filter`
section in the [Azure API
docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/resources/Resources/List).

### Build a host catalog

With the cloud provider details gathered, a plugin host catalog can now be
created that will contain the respective host sets for the database and
application filters.

### Create a host catalog plugin

Check that the ARM parameter environment variable values were set correctly in
your session.

```shell-session
$ echo $ARM_TENANT_ID; echo $ARM_SUBSCRIPTION_ID; echo $ARM_CLIENT_ID; echo $ARM_CLIENT_SECRET
0e3e2e88-8caf-41ca-b4da-q3b33b6c43tz
c9ed8610-47a3-4107-a2b2-a322114dkd78
c2f9b423-9aa1-4ed4-809d-0af5b28397f9
notarealtokenmG27Q~Kr842OROnJUwWtG0ygbfG5RKxe.DeZ-
```

If necessary, authenticate to Boundary as the admin user.

```shell-session
$ boundary authenticate
Please enter the login name (it will be hidden):
Please enter the password (it will be hidden):
Authentication information:
  Account ID:      acctpw_VOeNSFX8pQ
  Auth Method ID:  ampw_wxzojlKJLN
  Expiration Time: Mon, 13 Feb 2023 12:35:32 MST
  User ID:         u_1vUkf5fPs9
The token was successfully stored in the chosen keyring and is not displayed here.
```

Next, create a new plugin-type host catalog with a `-plugin-name` of `azure`,
providing the ARM Tenant ID, Subscription ID, and Client ID using the `-attr`
flag, and the ARM Client Secret using the `-secret` flag. These values should
map to the environment variables defined above.

```shell-session
$ boundary host-catalogs create plugin \
  -scope-id $PROJECT_ID \
  -plugin-name azure \
  -attr disable_credential_rotation=true \
  -attr tenant_id=env://ARM_TENANT_ID \
  -attr subscription_id=env://ARM_SUBSCRIPTION_ID \
  -attr client_id=env://ARM_CLIENT_ID \
  -secret secret_value=env://ARM_CLIENT_SECRET
```

Command flags:

- `-plugin-name`: This corresponds to the host catalog plugin's name, such as
`azure` or `aws`
- `disable_credential_rotation`: This tutorial utilizes a static secret by
setting this value to `true`
- `tenant_id`: The ARM Tenant(Directory) ID, supplied as an environment variable
- `subscription_id`: The ARM Subscription ID, supplied as an environment variable
- `client_id`: The ARM Client (Application) ID, supplied as an environment variable
- `secret_value`: The ARM Client Secret, supplied as an environment variable

<Note>

 Although credentials are stored encrypted within Boundary, by
default this plugin attempts to rotate credentials supplied through the
`secrets` object during a create or update call to the host catalog resource.
The given credentials will be used to create a new credential, and then the
given credential will be revoked. In this way, after rotation, only Boundary
knows the client secret in use by this plugin. Credential rotation will be
generally available in a future release of Boundary.

</Note>

Copy the host catalog ID from the output (`hcplg_zZfpE9UHlz` in this example) and
store it in the `HOST_CATALOG_ID` environment variable.

```shell-session
$ export HOST_CATALOG_ID=hcplg_zZfpE9UHlz
```

### Create the host sets

With the dynamic host catalog created, host sets can now be defined that
correspond to the service-type and application tags added to the hosts.

Recall the three host sets we wish to create:

- All hosts with a `service-type` tag of `database`
- All hosts with an `application` tag of `dev`
- All hosts with an `application` tag of `production`

The respective host set filters can be constructed as:

- `"tagName eq 'service-type' and tagValue eq 'database'"`
- `"tagName eq 'application' and tagValue eq 'dev'"`
- `"tagName eq 'application' and tagValue eq 'production'"`

Create the first plugin host set containing hosts tagged with a `service-type`
of `database`, supplying the host catalog ID copied above and the needed filter
using the `-attr` flag.

```shell-session
$ boundary host-sets create plugin \
  -name database \
  -host-catalog-id $HOST_CATALOG_ID \
  -attr filter="tagName eq 'service-type' and tagValue eq 'database'"
```

**Sample output:**

<CodeBlockConfig hideClipboard highlight="1-4,9">

```shell-session
$ boundary host-sets create plugin \
  -name database \
  -host-catalog-id $HOST_CATALOG_ID \
  -attr filter="tagName eq 'service-type' and tagValue eq 'database'"

<Note title="Troubleshooting">

 If the `boundary hosts list` command returns `No hosts
found`, expand the accordion below to check your work.

</Note>

<Accordion heading="Troubleshoot Missing Hosts" collapse>


If the host catalog is misconfigured, hosts will not be discoverable by
Boundary. There are two issues to check:

1. The host catalog ARM ID's supplied as environment variables are incorrect
1. The Azure subscription role of `Reader` has not been applied to the application

<Note>

 Depending on the type of configuration issue, you will need to wait
approximately 5 - 10 minutes for the existing host catalog or host sets to sync
with the provider and refresh their values. If you do not want to wait a new
host catalog and host set can be created from scratch, but these will also take
several minutes to sync upon creation.

</Note>

If incorrect, update the managed group filter. This process can also be used to
update the managed group filter criteria in the future for any existing managed
groups.

First, check the environment variables defined when [creating a host catalog
plugin](#create-a-host-catalog-plugin). Ensure these are the correct values
gathered when [setting up the cloud hosts](#set-up-cloud-hosts) in the Azure
portal.

If these are incorrectly defined, set the environment variables again,
and update the host catalog:

```shell-session
$ boundary host-catalogs update plugin \
  -id $HOST_CATALOG_ID \
  -plugin-name azure \
  -attr disable_credential_rotation=true \
  -attr tenant_id=env://ARM_TENANT_ID \
  -attr subscription_id=env://ARM_SUBSCRIPTION_ID \
  -attr client_id=env://ARM_CLIENT_ID \
  -secret secret_value=env://ARM_CLIENT_SECRET
```

Second, check is the Reader role assignment to the Azure AD application's
subscription. If incorrect permissions are assigned or the wrong application is
selected, Boundary will not be able to view the hosts from the application
granting it access.

Review the steps for [granting the application access to manage resources in
your Azure
Subscription](#grant-the-application-access-to-manage-resources-in-your-azure-subscription).

After correcting the role, give Boundary up to five minutes to refresh the
connection to Azure, and list the available hosts again.

</Accordion>

Now create a host set that correspond to the `application` tag of `dev`.

```shell-session
$ boundary host-sets create plugin \
  -name dev \
  -host-catalog-id $HOST_CATALOG_ID \
  -attr filter="tagName eq 'application' and tagValue eq 'dev'"
```

**Sample output:**

Lastly, create a host set that correspond to the `application` tag of
`production`.

example) and store it in the `PRODUCTION_HOST_SET_ID` environment variable.

```shell-session

```

## Verify catalog membership

With the `database`, `dev`, and `prod` host sets defined within the azure host
catalog, the next step is to verify that the four VM hosts listed as members of
the catalog are dynamically included in the correct host sets.

Host membership can be verified by reading the host set details and verifying
its membership IDs.

First, verify that the `database` host set contains all four members of the
azure host catalog.

Perform a read on the host set named `database` to view its members.

</CodeBlockConfig>

If the `Host IDs` section is missing, expand the troubleshooting accordion to
diagnose what could be wrong.

<Accordion heading="Troubleshoot Misconfigured Host Set" collapse>


If the host catalog is misconfigured, hosts will not be discoverable by
Boundary.

At this point in the tutorial hosts are contained within the host catalog, but
not appearing in one or more host sets. This implies that the host set itself is
misconfigured.

Above, you performed a `read` on the database host set. Check the `Attributes`
section, and verify it matches the correctly defined filter:

<CodeBlockConfig hideClipboard>

```
  Attributes:
    filter:            tagName eq 'service-type' and tagValue eq 'database'
```

</CodeBlockConfig>

If the tag is incorrectly assigned, perform an update on the affected host set
to fix the filter:

```shell-session
$ boundary host-sets update plugin \
  -id $DATABASE_HOST_SET_ID \
  -name production \
  -attr filter="tagName eq 'application' and tagValue eq 'production'"
```

After updating the filter, Boundary will automatically refresh the host set.

<Note>

 Depending on the type of configuration issue, you will need to wait
approximately 5 - 10 minutes for the existing host catalog or host sets to sync
with the provider and refresh their values. If you do not want to wait a new
host catalog and host set can be created from scratch, but these will also take
several minutes to sync upon creation.

</Note>

Check that the updated filter is working by performing another `read` on the
`database` host set.

```shell-session
$ boundary host-sets read -id $DATABASE_HOST_SET_ID
```

If the `dev` or `production` host sets are affected by incorrect filters, follow
the same procedure to update their filters accordingly.

</Accordion>

Next, read the `dev` host set details. Verify the Host IDs are the correctly
tagged hosts from the cloud provider.

Notice the `Host IDs` section of this output. Even though there are two production
VMs, only one is listed in the host set.

To figure out what could be wrong, compare the members of the `production` host
set to the members of the `database` host set. Remember, members of the
`production` and `dev` host sets are a sub-set of the `database` host set.

The `External ID` field shows the name of the misconfigured host:
`boundary-vm-4-production` (*Scroll to the right in the output to find
`/virtualMachines/boundary-vm-4-production`*).

<Note>

 Your configuration may show either `boundary-vm-3-production` or
`boundary-vm-4-production` as the misconfigured VM. Continue with the host that
is misconfigured.

</Note>

Recall that host set membership is defined based on the VM tags.

List the details for the `boundary-vm-4-production` VM, and query for its tag
values.

```shell-session
$ az vm show --resource-group boundary-dynamic-hosts_group --name boundary-vm-4-production --query 'tags'
{
  "application": "prod",
  "service-type": "database"
}
```

Notice that the `application` tag is misconfigured as `prod`, instead of
`production`. An easy mistake to make!

Remember the filter defined for the `production` host set:

`"tagName eq 'application' and tagValue eq 'production'"`

The `tagValue` must equal `production` exactly to be included in this host set.

<Note>

 It is possible to create a more generic filter that could include
`tagName` values that can be selected by prefix, but this would require a
restructure of the tagging schema for the VMs. To learn more about filters and
resource tagging, check the [Azure API
docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/resources/Resources/List).

</Note>

Update the `application` tag to `production`.

```shell-session
$ az vm update --resource-group boundary-dynamic-hosts_group --name boundary-vm-4-production --set tags.application=production
```

The output will display the updated tags, but you can re-run `az vm show` to
directly query for the tag values.

```shell-session
$ az vm show --resource-group boundary-dynamic-hosts_group --name boundary-vm-4-production --query 'tags'

The `External ID` field shows the name of the misconfigured host:
`boundary-vm-4` (*Scroll to the right in the output to find
`/virtualMachines/boundary-vm-4`*).

Recall that host set membership is defined based on the VM tags.

List the details for the `boundary-vm-4` VM, and query for its tag values.

```shell-session
$ az vm show --resource-group boundary-dynamic-hosts_group --name boundary-vm-4 --query 'tags'
{
  "application": "prod",
  "service-type": "database"
}
```

Notice that the `application` tag is misconfigured as `prod`, instead of
`production`. An easy mistake to make!

Remember the filter defined for the `production` host set:

`"tagName eq 'application' and tagValue eq 'production'"`

The `tagValue` must equal `production` exactly to be included in this host set.

<Note>

 It is possible to create a more generic filter that could include
`tagName` values that can be selected by prefix, but this would require a
restructure of the tagging schema for the VMs. To learn more about filters and
resource tagging, check the [Azure API
docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/resources/Resources/List).

</Note>

Update the `application` tag to `production` by fixing the misconfigured tags in
the `hosts.tf` configuration file.

<CodeBlockConfig lineNumbers highlight="13-16" hideClipboard filename="hosts.tf">

```hcl
# Configure the Azure VM hosts
variable "instances" {
  default = [
    "boundary-vm-1",
    "boundary-vm-2",
    "boundary-vm-3",
    "boundary-vm-4"
  ]
}

variable "vm_tags" {
  default = [
    {"service-type":"database", "application":"dev"},
    {"service-type":"database", "application":"dev"},
    {"service-type":"database", "application":"production"},
    {"service-type":"database", "application":"prod"}
  ]
}

...
...
...
```

</CodeBlockConfig>

Lines 13 - 16 define the tags for each VM. **Update the application tags on line
16 to match line 15**, such that `"application":"production"`.

```hcl
variable "vm_tags" {
  default = [
    {"service-type":"database", "application":"dev"},
    {"service-type":"database", "application":"dev"},
    {"service-type":"database", "application":"production"},
    {"service-type":"database", "application":"production"}
  ]
```

Run `terraform apply` and confirm the new configuration with `yes` when
prompted.

The `External ID` field shows the name of the misconfigured host:
`boundary-vm-4-production` (*Scroll to the right in the output to find
`/virtualMachines/boundary-vm-4-production`*).

<Note>

 Your configuration may show either `boundary-vm-3-production` or
`boundary-vm-4-production` as the misconfigured VM. Continue with the host that
is misconfigured.

</Note>

Return to the Azure Portal, and navigate to the `boundary-vm-4-production` VM
*Overview* Blade.

![Azure VM Overview](/img/boundary/azure/azure-app-dynamic-hosts-boundary-vm-4-production-overview.png)

Under the **Tags**, notice that the `application` tag is misconfigured as
`prod`, instead of `production`. An easy mistake to make!

Remember the filter defined for the `production` host set:

`"tagName eq 'application' and tagValue eq 'production'"`

The `tagValue` must equal `production` exactly to be included in this host set.

<Note>

 It is possible to create a more generic filter that could include
`tagName` values that can be selected by prefix, but this would require a
restructure of the tagging schema for the VMs. To learn more about filters and
resource tagging, check the [Azure API
docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/resources/Resources/List).

Update the Tags by clicking on **Edit**, and change the `application` tag to
`production`.

<Tab heading="CLI" group="cli">

1. Destroy the `boundary-dynamic-hosts_group` resource group in Azure.

   Delete all resources using `az group delete`. Enter `y` when prompted to
   confirm the operation.

   ```shell-session
   $ az group delete --name boundary-dynamic-hosts_group  --subscription $ARM_SUBSCRIPTION_ID
   Are you sure you want to perform this operation? (y/n):
    \ Running ..
   ```

   This will take some time.

   Verify that the resource group has been destroyed by listing the available
   resource groups.

   ```shell-session
   $ az group list
   ```

1. Delete the `Boundary Dynamic Hosts Test` sample application from Azure AD.

   Delete the `Boundary Dynamic Hosts Test` app using `az ad app delete`.

   ```
   $ az ad app delete --id $ARM_CLIENT_ID
   ```

   Check that the application has been destroyed by attempting to query its ID.

   ```shell-session
   $ az ad app show --id $ARM_CLIENT_ID
   Resource 'c2f9b423-9aa1-4ed4-809d-0af5b28397f9' does not exist or one of its queried reference-property objects are not present.

## Next steps

This tutorial demonstrated the steps to set up a dynamic host catalog using the
Azure host plugin. You deployed and tagged hosts within Azure, configured a
plugin-type host catalog within Boundary, and created three host sets that
filtered for the  hosts based on their tag values.

To learn more about integrating Boundary with cloud providers like AWS and
Azure, check out the [OIDC
Authentication](/boundary/tutorials/access-management/oidc-auth)
tutorial.
