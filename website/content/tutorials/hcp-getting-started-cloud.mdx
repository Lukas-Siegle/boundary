The HashiCorp Cloud Platform (HCP) is a fully managed platform which is operated by HashiCorp
allowing organizations to get up and running quickly. Customers get production-grade infrastructure,
built-in security, and pay-as-you-go pricing to accelerate cloud adoption. HCP Boundary provides
a consistent user experience compared to a self-managed Boundary cluster.

### How does HCP Boundary work?

Organizations that adopt HCP Boundary can focus on integrating Boundary into
their environments without the need to focus on traditional operational tasks,
such as which operating system to deploy the Boundary cluster on, how to manage
and monitor the Boundary application, or how to upgrade to newer versions of
Boundary.

Boundary can be deployed in just a few clicks via the HashiCorp Cloud Platform
Portal. Once deployed, Boundary administrators can interact with Boundary
through the admin console or command line interface (CLI) to manage orgs, users,
groups, permissions, and roles to provide fine-grained access to Boundary
targets and projects.

### Support and community
